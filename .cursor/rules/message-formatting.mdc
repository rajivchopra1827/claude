# Message Formatting

When drafting messages (Slack, email, or any communication), write them in plain text without markdown blockquote formatting.

## Don't Use Blockquotes for Draft Messages

❌ **BAD** - Using ">" blockquote syntax:

```
> Hey team,
> 
> I'm canceling tomorrow's meeting.
> 
> Thanks
```

✅ **GOOD** - Plain text:

```
Hey team,

I'm canceling tomorrow's meeting.

Thanks
```

## Why

- Blockquotes make it harder to copy/paste
- They add unnecessary visual formatting
- Plain text is easier to work with

## When to Use Blockquotes

Only use blockquotes (">") when quoting someone else's text for context or reference, not for drafting new messages.
