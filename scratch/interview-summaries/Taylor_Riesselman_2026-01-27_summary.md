## Builder/Operator Competencies

*Critical for Year 1 success - building the machine*

### ⚙️ Execution / Org Process

**Grade:** A-

**Assessment:** Strong evidence of building systems from scratch and creating operational processes. Built automation platform and end-to-end customer experience platform across 10 years at Sojourn. Demonstrated ability to prioritize ruthlessly (simplest use cases first, then expand) and establish predictable delivery through quarterly planning processes.

**Evidence:**

> "We broke down what we were trying to solve for... we're gonna start with first party campaigns running on display only with straightforward KPIs... single KPI, first party reporting. Very, very, very straightforward campaigns."

> "We have a quarterly planning process now where we actually have an intake process first... each PM goes into that and says, okay. Based on the priority, and the impact of these things... Each PM prioritizes within their own functional area."

> "We have a single Slack channel. We communicate all releases through that Slack channel. Demos with each of our releases. We have a whole release process for getting the prompts together and making sure that we're communicating to the right people."

> "Built it all in one platform so that it was kind of this, like, end to end streamlined flow."

- Built quarterly planning with intake, prioritization, capacity planning, and OKRs
- Created release process with consistent communication (Slack channel, demos, emails)
- Prioritized by customer segment and complexity to maximize impact

**Strengths:**

- Clear methodology for prioritizing (complexity + prevalence of use case)
- Built sustainable operating rhythms (quarterly planning, road map previews)
- Strong release process with demos and stakeholder communication
- Migrated legacy customers while iterating on platform — managed both tracks simultaneously

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Initial automation platform vision was "very blurry" — vision came from VP, Taylor executed
- Some internal tools still not integrated (creative mapping mentioned as in progress)
- Acknowledged that first platform attempts were "not super well" organized with shared engineering resources

### 🌱 Org Building / People Management

**Grade:** B+

**Assessment:** Solid evidence of building and scaling PM teams. Grew from 4 PMs to 9, then restructured to sustainable 4+4 split with a counterpart. Team described as "very high performing" and autonomous. Self-identified gap in providing regular structured feedback.

**Evidence:**

> "At one point, I think I had nine PMs reporting to me. Which was far too many, just to be clear. It was actually unmanageable. And then I got a new VP, and he came in and said, this is [too many]. And so he broke it into two."

> "I think my team would say supportive and transparent. My team operates at a very high level, so I'm very lucky in that. They're very high performing. They're very autonomous. They are very independent."

> "I hired most of them, so I guess I made some good choices there."

> "We tried to hire we tried to hire externally. It did not work... it takes a lot of inherent knowledge to actually be able to prioritize things for an automation platform. You have to, like, know how to run a campaign."

- Grew team from 4 to 9 PMs, recognized it was unmanageable, restructured to 4+4 with counterpart
- Hired both internally and externally; learned that domain knowledge matters for certain roles
- Team is autonomous and high-performing

**Strengths:**

- Built high-performing, autonomous team culture
- Recognized when team size was unmanageable and supported restructuring
- Learned lesson about domain expertise for specialized roles (automation platform PM)
- Provides transparency so team can operate independently with good context

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

> "I think my team would say more feedback. More feedback... I do real time feedback fairly well, but, like, in a regular one on one, I'm not necessarily coming prepared with feedback a lot of the time."

- Self-identified: needs to provide more structured, formal feedback beyond real-time
- Less evidence of developing people vs. hiring the right people
- Acknowledged that time is the constraint — needs to "make more time for it"

### 🤝 Influence

**Grade:** A

**Assessment:** Exceptional evidence of influencing stakeholders, managing up, and navigating tensions with product leadership. Demonstrated ability to course-correct publicly when needed while maintaining relationships. Strong track record of building trust through consistent delivery.

**Evidence:**

> "He always wanted me to present at the all hands. And I would go in, and I would comment on those slides... I would say, hey. I'm not comfortable communicating this timeline because I think that the timeline's actually gonna be this."

> "I had to actually... course correct that pretty publicly, which I, again, I don't love. I don't love that. I like being aligned with my leader... But I think in the moment, I felt like I had to because it was within our leadership board. Right? So the CPO was there, and our CEO was there."

> "That shift doesn't come by telling people to just be okay with ambiguity. It comes by setting expectations and meeting expectations not a 100% of the time. But 99% of the time, 90% of the time."

> "I think that's been, like, the biggest game changer for us is like, if you can meet most of them, people start to get on board with, okay. I can live with a little bit of ambiguity."

- Pushed back on unrealistic timelines while maintaining strong relationship with VP
- Publicly course-corrected in front of CPO/CEO when necessary
- Built stakeholder trust through consistent delivery over time

**Strengths:**

- Understands that trust is built through consistent delivery, not just communication
- Comfortable having difficult conversations with leadership
- Maintains strong relationships even when pushing back
- Strategic about when to push back (privately) vs. course-correct (publicly when stakes are high)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- VP's overpromising sometimes damaged stakeholder trust despite Taylor's efforts
- Recent acquisition creating new stakeholder dynamics she's still navigating
- May need to adjust approach when entering organization where trust hasn't been established

## Product Leadership Competencies

*PM fundamentals that matter ongoing*

### 🧭 Direction

**Grade:** B

**Assessment:** Solid strategic execution skills but positioned herself as "the executor" rather than vision-setter. Strong at translating VP's vision into actionable roadmaps and prioritization. Less evidence of independently creating product vision or strategy.

**Evidence:**

> "I think that he played the face of the product and I played the doer. Right? Like, I was the executor. I was making sure we were, like, getting stuff done and making progress, and meeting goals and delivering outcomes."

> "His vision was great. Execute on it. We deliver it. It's amazing."

> "We built the road map based on impact customer segmentation. Right? Like, how can we have the biggest impact the quickest? So we started with our smallest customer base... just display. So we were only supporting the ones that were running only display."

> "We went from display to our next biggest channel, which was search and then Facebook."

- Translated vision into actionable prioritization framework
- Built roadmaps based on customer segmentation and impact
- Systematically expanded scope (channel by channel, segment by segment)

**Strengths:**

- Excellent at operationalizing vision into roadmaps
- Strong prioritization methodology (segment × complexity × impact)
- Systematic approach to expansion (one channel at a time, one segment at a time)
- Practical trade-off thinking (when automation was "good enough," shifted focus)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Less evidence of independently setting product vision
- Self-describes as executor, not visionary
- Strategic direction largely came from VPs; Taylor made it real
- This may actually be a **fit** for the role given Rajiv's positioning as vision/strategy owner

### 💡 Insight

**Grade:** B-

**Assessment:** Strong operational and business metrics understanding, but less evidence of deep customer research or discovery processes. Insight comes primarily from data analysis and internal stakeholder input rather than direct customer research.

**Evidence:**

> "What we looked at was just a number of campaigns that were being run... they got to a point where they were running probably 2,500 campaigns. It was like 500 campaigns per person."

> "Revenue per head is kind of what we looked at. And our revenue per head... we did track growth of revenue per head as we scaled."

> "So basically, those two things and as a kind of interconnect. So if someone canceled because, like, they weren't getting a response, that wouldn't necessarily hurt the, you know, KPIs of our system. But if they cancel because we weren't able to hit their KPIs, then we would take on that."

> "It was a value prop. It is yelled about loudly about the fact that, like, we're using all this information, this data, and this technology in order to, like, better optimize your campaigns."

- Tracked business metrics: revenue per head, % campaigns performing, retention
- Understood customer value proposition (automation as confidence-builder)
- Domain expertise from 10 years in travel advertising

**Strengths:**

- Strong business metrics fluency
- Deep domain expertise from starting as analyst running campaigns manually
- Understands the "why" customers care (performance, scaling)
- Good at separating signal from noise in cancellation reasons

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Less evidence of formal user research or discovery processes
- Customer insight seems to come from metrics and stakeholder input, not direct research
- No mention of customer interviews, discovery frameworks, or qualitative research
- Background is analyst → PM, less UX/research orientation

## Overall Assessment

Taylor Riesselman is a **strong fit for the operational/execution aspects of the Director of Product role**. Her 10 years at Sojourn building automation platforms and customer experience products in a company that transitioned from "100% commercially led" to product-led closely mirrors Digible's current situation.

**Strongest Areas:**

- **⚙️ Execution / Org Process (A-)**: Built quarterly planning processes, release processes, and delivered complex multi-year initiatives. The systematic approach (simple → complex, one segment at a time) shows operational maturity.
- **🤝 Influence (A)**: Exceptional at managing up, pushing back on unrealistic expectations, and building stakeholder trust through consistent delivery. This is critical given the trust-rebuilding needed at Digible.
- **Domain Similarity**: Travel advertising → multifamily digital marketing has strong parallels. Both are managed services with automation platforms, both serve time-poor customers, both involve channel management.

**Growth Areas:**

- **🧭 Direction (B)**: Self-describes as "the executor" not the visionary. Less evidence of independently creating product vision. This may be a **feature, not a bug** if Rajiv is stepping into vision/strategy while this role operationalizes.
- **💡 Insight (B-)**: Strong on business metrics, weaker on customer research and discovery. May need to develop more qualitative research capabilities.
- **🌱 Org Building (B+)**: Good at building teams but self-identified gap in providing structured feedback. At scale, this could limit PM development.

**Role Fit Analysis:**

Rajiv described needing someone who:
| Role Requirement | Taylor's Evidence | Fit |
|------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Operationalize strategy → execution | "I was the executor... making sure we were getting stuff done" | ✅ Strong |
| Build planning processes | Built quarterly planning with intake, capacity planning, OKRs | ✅ Strong |
| Manage day-to-day of teams | Currently manages 4 PMs, previously 9 | ✅ Strong |
| Rebuild stakeholder trust | "Setting expectations and meeting expectations 90% of the time" | ✅ Strong |
| Navigate non-product-minded org | 10 years at commercially-led company | ✅ Strong |

**Motivation Check:**

Taylor is leaving because Sojourn was acquired in November and the culture is changing. This is a legitimate reason, but worth probing whether she's genuinely excited about Digible or primarily escaping her current situation.

## Key Takeaways

- 10 years building automation and customer experience platforms at travel advertising company (strong domain parallel)
- Self-describes as "the executor" — strong at operationalizing vision, less at creating it
- Built quarterly planning process from scratch — exactly what Digible needs
- Exceptional at managing up and stakeholder influence — built trust through consistent delivery
- Growth area: providing structured feedback to team (self-identified)
- Growth area: customer research and discovery (primarily data/metrics-driven insight)
- Leaving post-acquisition — genuine culture mismatch or opportunistic timing?
- All experience at one company — may lack breadth of perspectives

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

- You described yourself as "the executor" while your VP was "the face of the product." If there was no one setting the vision above you, how would you approach creating product vision yourself?
- Tell me about a time you conducted customer research that fundamentally changed your understanding. What methodology did you use and what did you learn?
- Your team wants more structured feedback from you. What specifically would you do differently in your one-on-ones to address this?
- You've been at Sojourn for 10 years. What concerns you about joining a new organization where you don't have established relationships and trust?
- The acquisition seems to be a major factor in your decision to leave. What specifically changed that doesn't align with your values? How do you know that won't happen at Digible?
- Can you give me an example of a strategic bet you made that didn't work out? What happened and what did you learn?
