## Builder/Operator Competencies

*Critical for Year 1 success - building the machine*

### ⚙️ Execution / Org Process

**Grade:** A

**Assessment:** Exceptional evidence of building systems and processes from scratch, with particular strength in simplifying overly complex methodologies and driving rapid execution improvement

**Evidence:**

> My 3060, 90. The first 30 days was just keep my damn mouth shut, watch everything they do, don't even ask questions. Just, like, get a lay of the land... And then from day 30 to day 60 is to get to the why. Like, why are you doing these things the way you've been doing them?... And then the last 30 days was more of, okay, let's make suggestions.

> They were so deep into Agile and Scrum and Jira and Confluence... this was a team of 25 in product engineering and we're using it for a team of 250. So we had to kind of pull back.

> So we launched a 50 plus retailers, 15 manufacturers, 5,000 farmers, reduced cycles from two to three months per release to two to three weeks per release.

> We chucked the roadmap. It was a two year roadmap that they were a year behind on. We started with a six month roadmap and grew from there, kind of giving everybody the baby step approach.

- Created roadmap tracker with 100% completion target (not 75%, not 150% - indicating good estimation discipline)
- Replaced project management culture with product management mindset

**Strengths:**

- Clear 30/60/90 methodology for assessing and transforming organizations
- Skilled at right-sizing processes (removed unnecessary Agile overhead)
- Dramatic improvement in release velocity (2-3 months → 2-3 weeks)
- Practical approach to roadmapping (baby steps, not big bang)
- "Calm urgency" leadership style balances speed with team stability

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- By his own admission: "I don't let enough go... I would kind of dwell on some of the more micro issues" - may need to develop more comfort with acceptable losses at scale
- Growers was a shorter engagement (15 months) so less evidence of sustaining improvements long-term

### 🌱 Org Building / People Management

**Grade:** B+

**Assessment:** Solid evidence of building product organizations from scratch; more emphasis on restructuring than developing individuals

**Evidence:**

> I had it. It was a transform, right? I had to go in and transform the company. I knew they were going to do a reorg before I got there, had to figure out how and had to redo the process and everything.

> The PMs were basically Project managers there... I got rid of two, kept one. Made her into one of the better product managers I've seen. But she had been there for six years.

> I'm very much again, a calm urgency type of guy... with like a team effort, player, coach, like show by example and very much. I'm going to delegate this to you, and I'm going to explain why I'm delegating it to you.

> I created a culture team at Automated Insights back when that was unheard of.

- At Growers: Reorganized from 25 to 15, then refined to better balance
- At Spiffy: Built entire product organization from scratch (data team, design, QA, product ops, customer support, innovation/R&D)
- Built data team at Spiffy with 2 immediate hires focused on data enrichment

**Strengths:**

- Experience building product orgs from zero (Spiffy, Growers)
- Player-coach mentality with emphasis on "why" behind delegation
- Culture-conscious leadership (created culture team at Automated Insights)
- Strong partnership model (Maggie at Spiffy as "right hand person")
- Successfully transformed project manager into product manager

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- More evidence of restructuring/cutting than developing people
- Less discussion of coaching methodology or PM development
- Only one clear example of developing someone (the PM he kept at Growers)
- Most team building stories are about hiring right vs. growing people

### 🤝 Influence

**Grade:** A-

**Assessment:** Strong cross-functional partnership skills, particularly with customer-facing teams; operates effectively in executive triumvirate model

**Evidence:**

> The head of customer support there was my right hand person... she and I were actually the vaporware that powered a lot of these MVPs before they became product.

> Scott did that I will never do again... he had everybody in the bullpen out front, and the executive team sat right next to customer support. So I heard the calls coming in, I heard the emails.

> Spiffy turned into Scott, CEO, Ryan, the CTO, and me doing a Monday morning, like, prioritization meeting every two weeks to be like, okay, this is the future of where we're taking the company next in terms of the product lens.

> Growers was basically me, the CEO, the cfo, deciding strategy... So I was able to lead those discussions there.

- Operates effectively in triumvirate model (CEO/CFO/CPO or CEO/CTO/CPO)
- Built strong partnerships with customer support leaders at both companies

**Strengths:**

- Values proximity to customer support/customer voice
- Comfortable operating at executive level for strategy decisions
- Collaborative approach to direction-setting (not dictating, but leading discussions)
- Can translate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences (identified as superpower)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Less evidence of managing difficult stakeholders or conflict
- Most influence examples are peer-level partnerships, less managing up
- Limited discussion of navigating organizational resistance to change

## Product Leadership Competencies

*PM fundamentals that matter ongoing*

### 🧭 Direction

**Grade:** A

**Assessment:** Strong evidence of identifying strategic pivots and reframing product direction; excels at finding non-obvious opportunities through data

**Evidence:**

> My mandate was to come get the team on stuck... Once I started pulling the threads, like we're doing now, on the process, the people, and specifically the data. That's when... we hit on the fact that we're just doing it wrong again.

> Let's give the retailers the information that they need to make this purchase... we turned what was like buy online e-commerce play into a loyalty and incentive... it 10x the revenue in the first month.

> After the 12 point check, we started making the vehicle the model. So our target is anybody with a vehicle.

> Automated content is to write where humans can't or won't... that's when it hit me that, oh, automated content is to write where humans can't or won't write.

- Automated Insights: Reframed from "cool sports data" to "content where humans can't or won't write"
- Growers: Pivoted from farmer-direct e-commerce to retailer incentive platform (10x revenue impact)
- Spiffy: Shifted from service-centric to vehicle-centric model, enabling fleet expansion

**Strengths:**

- Pattern of finding strategic pivots others missed (Automated Insights, Growers, Spiffy)
- Data-informed direction setting (not just intuition)
- Clear articulation of business model transformations
- Understands the difference between what customers say and what drives revenue

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Less evidence of long-term vision creation vs. pivoting existing direction
- Most examples are about fixing what's broken, less about creating new vision
- Could demonstrate more about setting multi-year product vision

---

### 💡 Insight

**Grade:** A

**Assessment:** Exceptional data-driven insight generation; built systems for continuous learning from operations

**Evidence:**

> One of the first problems I saw was we had technicians in four cities touching thousands of cars every day... we're not doing anything with that data.

> What I changed that to is let's do a quick 12 point inspection. It'll take them 30 seconds... one of the things was, is there a car seat?... The car seat thing really, really worked well.

> Your job is to enrich. So I had those three people there... we went out and got partnerships with Motor... carfax... the OEMs themselves... chemical companies and cleaning companies.

> The first thing I would tell them is always listen to customer support. The techs in the field, the operations folks, and all your developers... they will give you heads up about what's going to go wrong.

- Built data science teams at both Growers and Spiffy
- Created 12-point inspection that added 12% to top line, 10% to bottom line
- Data enrichment strategy through external partnerships (Motor, Carfax, OEMs)

**Strengths:**

- Deeply data-driven approach to insight generation
- Built systems to capture operational data (12-point inspection)
- Combines quantitative data with qualitative inputs (customer support calls)
- Values multiple sources of insight (field ops, developers, support)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Less evidence of traditional user research methodology
- Discovery approach is more operational/transactional than exploratory
- Could demonstrate more qualitative research depth

## AI & Technology Competency

*Highly relevant to Digible's strategic direction*

**Grade:** A+

**Assessment:** Deep AI background dating to 2011; one of the strongest technical/AI foundations among candidates

**Evidence:**

> Automated Insights... we raised 11 and a half million dollars. Created billions of pieces. Automated content. This starts in 2011. So we're like, 10 years ahead of OpenAI.

> Having all this AI knowledge under my belt was really, really valuable at the beginning of 2025. And I found this sort of unwanted niche... I've been working with hotels, software for hotels, software for restaurants, software for storage spaces.

> I kind of cut my teeth on the data science part, the analysis AI automation rag, all the way up to causal AI.

> Automated content is to write where humans can't or won't write.

- 15+ years of AI/ML experience predating the current AI boom
- Currently consulting on AI transformation for hospitality/services industries
- Understands full AI stack: data science, automation, RAG, causal AI

**Strengths:**

- Rare combination of product leadership + deep AI expertise
- Has lived through AI hype cycles and understands sustainable value creation
- Experience with AI in operational/transactional contexts (similar to Digible)
- Understands that AI enables new value, not just automation of existing work

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Most AI experience is in different domains (sports, automotive, agriculture)
- Less marketing-specific AI experience

## Overall Assessment

Joe brings a unique combination of product leadership and deep AI/data expertise that is highly relevant to Digible's strategic direction. His strongest pattern is identifying strategic pivots through data analysis and building operational systems that generate continuous insight.

**Strongest Areas:**
- **🧭 Direction (A)**: Exceptional at finding non-obvious strategic pivots (Growers retailer pivot, Spiffy vehicle-centric model, Automated Insights content positioning). Each of these fundamentally reframed the business.
- **💡 Insight (A)**: Deeply data-driven with systems thinking. The 12-point inspection at Spiffy is a great example of building insight infrastructure, not just doing one-off analysis.
- **⚙️ Execution (A)**: Strong evidence of simplifying overly complex processes and dramatically improving velocity. The 2-3 months → 2-3 weeks transformation at Growers is impressive.
- **🤖 AI/Tech (A+)**: This is a differentiator. 15+ years of AI experience, predating the current boom. Understands AI at depth (data science through causal AI) and has applied it to operational contexts similar to Digible's.

**Growth Areas:**
- **🌱 Org Building (B+)**: More evidence of restructuring than developing people. Less coaching/development examples compared to hiring/firing decisions.
- **Letting go**: By his own admission, tends to dwell on micro issues and has learned (but may still struggle with) letting things go during hypergrowth.
- **Long-term vision**: Strong at pivots and direction-setting, less evidence of creating multi-year product vision from scratch.

**Cultural Fit:**
His explicit enthusiasm for company culture (created culture team at Automated Insights, wrote about Digible's 4-day work week in Inc. Magazine before the interview) suggests strong cultural alignment. The "calm urgency" style and player-coach mentality would likely fit well with Digible's values.

**Comparison to Role Requirements:**
The role anti-sell emphasized that "the organization today is not set up for success" with gaps in talent density, capacity, and operational maturity. Joe's pattern of transforming stuck organizations (Growers) and building product orgs from scratch (Spiffy) is directly relevant. His AI expertise is particularly valuable given Digible's AI-native vision.

## Key Takeaways

- 15+ years AI/data experience predating current boom — rare and valuable for AI-native strategy
- Strong pattern of finding strategic pivots through data (Growers 10x revenue pivot)
- Built product orgs from nothing at both Spiffy and Growers
- "Calm urgency" player-coach leadership style
- Deep belief in customer support proximity as insight source
- Acknowledged weakness: can get stuck on micro issues during hypergrowth
- Currently actively consulting on AI transformation for similar industries (hotels, services)
- Wrote about Digible positively in Inc. Magazine (shows genuine interest)

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

- You mentioned you "don't let enough go" during hypergrowth. Can you give me a specific example of when this hurt you and what you learned?
- Tell me about a PM you developed significantly — not just kept, but actively coached to a higher level of performance. What did that process look like?
- Your pivots at Growers and Spiffy were impressive. Tell me about a strategic bet you made that didn't work out. What happened and what did you learn?
- Most of your examples involve fixing stuck organizations. If you were building Digible's 3-year product vision from scratch, how would you approach that differently than a turnaround?
- How do you balance your data-driven approach with qualitative user research? What's an example where the data told you one thing but talking to customers revealed something different?
- What specifically excited you about Digible that led you to write about us in Inc. Magazine before we even spoke?
