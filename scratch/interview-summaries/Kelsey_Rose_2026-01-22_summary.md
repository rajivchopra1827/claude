## Builder/Operator Competencies

*Critical for Year 1 success - building the machine*

### ⚙️ Execution / Org Process

**Grade:** B-

**Assessment:** Demonstrated ability to build processes and systems, but gaps in operationalizing strategy into quarterly/monthly execution cycles. Struggled with delegation initially, which impacted execution effectiveness.

**Evidence:**

> I developed it myself when I was an individual contributor. They really had no fundamentals about how they shipped things, how they ideated on things. What we were doing after it was shipped. So I built that full process and then modified it year after year.

> I really struggled with that because again, I owned it by myself for so long. I had a lot of pride in what I did, and I had a lot of ownership over what I had. And so trying to change this and that and trust my team enough to take those things on was a transition for me that I needed to do.

> His biggest piece of feedback for me was, you are one person. You cannot do everything. You need to delegate, and you need to trust your team. You hire these people for a reason.

- Built product development process from scratch at GoFormz
- Established outcome-based roadmaps with OKR-style structure
- Created annual product kickoff (PKO) process
- Focused on building 3-quarter visibility for roadmaps

**Strengths:**

- Built comprehensive product development process where none existed
- Iterated on processes based on team feedback
- Established structured planning cycles (annual PKO, quarterly planning)
- Outcome-oriented approach to roadmaps

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Limited evidence of translating annual/quarterly strategy into concrete monthly execution plans
- Initial struggle with delegation required direct boss intervention ("You are one person. You cannot do everything")
- Process building focused more on structure than operationalization into day-to-day execution
- Less evidence of repeatable execution rhythms that translate strategy to immediate action

### 🌱 Org Building / People Management

**Grade:** B

**Assessment:** Successfully built a product team from scratch (1 PM to 6-person team), but struggled with delegation and releasing IC responsibilities. Team building was effective, but management maturity was a growth area.

**Evidence:**

> I was fortunate in the way of I had owned the product for about two years. I was that solo product manager. I knew very intimately what the product needed and where those levers could be pulled for us to move the needle.

> I hired three PMs, a UI designer. A UX researcher and a documentation specialist that all worked underneath me, and together we owned and built the entire roadmap and strategy through my entire time there.

> I really struggled with that because again, I owned it by myself for so long. I had a lot of pride in what I did, and I had a lot of ownership over what I had. And so trying to change this and that and trust my team enough to take those things on was a transition for me that I needed to do. It's definitely something I'm always working on.

> One of the biggest things I learned from that was not only my own experience of needing to delegate and treat myself reasonably and be able to focus on the strategy and the roadmap rather than the execution as much as I wanted to as an individual contributor, but also give them an opportunity to learn. I was robbing my team of opportunities to learn by not taking on new things.

- Built team from 1 PM (herself) to 6-person product organization
- Maintained 3.5 year average tenure across team
- Made thoughtful hiring decisions based on strain points
- Eventually delegated QBRs and roadmap reviews to senior PMs

**Strengths:**

- Proven ability to build product organization from scratch
- Thoughtful hiring sequence (workflow PM, designer, data capture PM, growth PM)
- High team retention (3.5 year average tenure)
- Recognized impact of not delegating on team development

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Required boss intervention to learn delegation ("You are one person. You cannot do everything")
- Admitted this was "something I'm always working on" - indicating ongoing challenge, not mastery
- Struggled with releasing IC responsibilities due to pride and ownership
- Limited specific examples of coaching/developing ICs beyond delegation

### 🤝 Influence

**Grade:** B-

**Assessment:** Good communication and relationship-building skills, but struggled with managing frustration when dealing with resistant stakeholders. Required coaching intervention to handle cross-functional conflicts effectively.

**Evidence:**

> I think he's saying by Kryptonite is probably feeling a bit too much when I get into conflicts with other department heads. So, for example, we would have. We had 1 Our CMO was very challenging individual to work with, and he was one of those people that was very much so stuck in his ways and he wasn't evolving.

> And so I would get quite frustrated of we could do evolve. We're changing, the world is changing. We can use AI now, for example, what are we doing with aeo? I would ask all these questions and Lars would pull me aside and you say, look, you're asking the right questions. You are asking the right things. He's not ready to hear them yet. He is not ready.

> I learned the hard way where if you have a siloed product vision, you will not have a product vision at all. Then nobody will be on board. I would run yearly a pko, and the best thing that I did in that experience is kind of similar to a sales kickoff, same thing. I just adapted it to product.

> But we would bring in the heads of each department, and at the beginning of each year, the heads of each department would talk about, this is what we're trying to achieve. So sales would come in and be like, this is what we're trying to achieve this. Year. This is how product and engineering can help us achieve that.

- Created annual PKO process to align departments
- Built relationships across functions (sales, engineering, executives)
- Established weekly department-PM syncs for bidirectional feedback
- Took ownership of cross-company problems (implemented Notion knowledge base)

**Strengths:**

- Created structured forums for cross-functional alignment (annual PKO)
- Proactive in building relationships across departments
- Understood importance of getting buy-in (learned "siloed product vision" lesson)
- Took initiative on cross-functional problems (knowledge base implementation)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Identified frustration with resistant stakeholders as her "kryptonite"
- Required boss coaching to manage frustration ("He's not ready to hear them yet")
- Limited evidence of influencing without authority in difficult situations
- Pattern of getting frustrated when stakeholders aren't ready for change
- Less evidence of patiently influencing resistant stakeholders without intervention

## Product Leadership Competencies

*PM fundamentals that matter ongoing*

### 🧭 Direction

**Grade:** B

**Assessment:** Strong strategic thinking and vision-setting capabilities, but gaps in operationalizing strategy into quarterly/monthly execution. Built annual visions and roadmaps, but less evidence of breaking down strategy into actionable execution plans.

**Evidence:**

> We focused on being the top intelligent process management platform for construction and energy, mid market and enterprise companies. That was our vision, and we were really focused on the intelligent piece, intelligence piece, having a separate AI roadmap and strategy that looped into our roadmap.

> We would whittle it down. Understand we dissect every single word of it. My documentation specialist was phenomenal for this because he's a very much so word guy. And he would pull in like, okay, what does intelligent mean? What does process management mean? And we would really break that down.

> I aim to build out three quarters in advance. So I'm looking at my team. Okay. This is what we're thriving for. What are we looking for for Q2, right? Now, do we need to make any adjustments to Q1? Do we need to make adjustments to cube three?

> We had an overarching North Star that we're focusing on. That was our product vision. We whittled that down into goals. So more achievable goals. But their goals that are achievable within the next year, they're not achievable within the next quarter.

- Removed data capture from vision entirely, pivoted to "intelligent process management platform"
- Built outcome-based roadmaps with OKR-style structure
- Created annual product kickoff to refine vision and goals
- Established 3-quarter roadmap visibility

**Strengths:**

- Clear strategic thinking (pivoted from data capture to process management)
- Outcome-oriented approach (OKR-style roadmaps)
- Structured vision refinement process (annual PKO, word dissection)
- Long-term planning capability (3-quarter visibility)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Limited evidence of translating annual/quarterly strategy into monthly execution plans
- Focus on "goals achievable within the next year" but less on breaking down to monthly cycles
- Less evidence of operationalizing strategy into "what are we doing this quarter? What are we doing this month?"
- Strategic planning strong, but execution planning weaker

### 💡 Insight

**Grade:** B+

**Assessment:** Solid customer understanding and market awareness, with good processes for gathering customer feedback. Less evidence of sophisticated discovery methodology or translating insights into disruptive product decisions.

**Evidence:**

> I had my first product management role at Blend Labs, which was a fascinating way to get started in product management because it was a consulting agency where they served everything from a beauty app all the way to an ERP for a electric car last mile company. And so I had a breadth of experiences within customers, within working with different individuals, different individuals who had different motivations and different levels of understanding of what they were trying to do.

> Enterprise customers need data sent to 20+ places in 3+ formats. Currently handled manually by admins. Workflow automation was primary retention driver.

> We would also pick out customers that we were trying to get right. So they were opportunities. We didn't get them yet. We're like, hey, why don't you come in, give us some feedback.

- Broad customer exposure through consulting work (Blend Labs)
- Identified key customer insight: enterprise needs data sent to 20+ places in 3+ formats
- Recognized workflow automation as retention driver
- Engaged with both current customers and opportunities for feedback

**Strengths:**

- Broad customer exposure across different industries and customer types
- Identified strategic customer insights (enterprise data distribution needs)
- Understood retention drivers (workflow automation stickiness)
- Engaged diverse customer perspectives (current + opportunities)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Less evidence of sophisticated discovery methodology or validation techniques
- Limited discussion of how insights translated to specific product decisions beyond high-level strategy
- Could demonstrate deeper qualitative research skills
- Less evidence of insight-driven disruption vs. customer feedback-driven iteration

## Overall Assessment

Kelsey Rose demonstrates strong foundational product management skills with particular strength in building teams and establishing product processes. However, there are three non-negotiable gaps for the Director of Product role at Digible:

**Strongest Areas:**
- **🌱 Org Building (B)**: Successfully built product organization from scratch (1 PM → 6-person team) with high retention. Thoughtful hiring decisions and team development.
- **💡 Insight (B+)**: Broad customer exposure and ability to identify strategic customer insights. Good understanding of retention drivers and market dynamics.
- **🧭 Direction (B)**: Strong strategic thinking and vision-setting. Clear outcome-oriented approach to roadmaps and planning.

**Critical Gaps (Non-Negotiable for This Role):**

1. **⚙️ Operationalization (B-)**: While strong at strategic planning and process creation, there's limited evidence of translating 1-3 year strategy into concrete quarterly/monthly execution plans. This role specifically requires someone who can bridge the gap between strategy and day-to-day execution, which is currently a struggle for the product organization.

2. **🌱 Delegation Maturity (B)**: Required direct boss intervention to learn delegation ("You are one person. You cannot do everything"). Admitted this was "something I'm always working on" - indicating ongoing challenge rather than mastery. This role requires someone who has already mastered delegation and can operate fully at strategic level.

3. **🤝 Managing Frustration (B-)**: Identified frustration with resistant stakeholders as her "kryptonite." Required coaching intervention when dealing with CMO who wasn't ready for change. This role requires extensive change management work with stakeholders who may resist change, and the ability to navigate these situations without frustration is critical.

**Cultural Fit:**
Kelsey's experience building teams and processes aligns with Digible's needs, but the gaps in operationalization, delegation maturity, and managing frustration are non-negotiable for this specific role given the current organizational challenges and requirements.
