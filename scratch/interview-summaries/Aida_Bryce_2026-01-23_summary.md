## Builder/Operator Competencies

*Critical for Year 1 success - building the machine*

### ⚙️ Execution / Org Process

**Grade:** A

**Assessment:** Strong evidence of both delivering outcomes under pressure AND building sustainable systems

**Evidence:**

> I really come into companies when their vision is clear... they really need somebody now to come in and help create that vision into a true strategic plan, figure out how to actually execute, create those operating rhythms. To bring focus to the teams, bring predictability.

> We moved from feature prioritization to outcome prioritization. That conversation wasn't only a conversation within product, that's where I actually created stakeholder forums to have those discussions regularly.

> We came up with our own rhythm and math of, based on the seniority of the engineers who's on the team, we came up with our true small, medium, larges that were actually based around some metrics.

- Established velocity tracking system with sizing (small = 1 engineer / 2 weeks, large = 3 engineers / 3 months)
- Created advisory customer groups (AdCo) with monthly cadences for structured customer feedback
- Set up continuous delivery and daily deployments as part of platform discipline

**Strengths:**

- Explicit focus on creating operating rhythms and predictability
- Moved from ad-hoc to structured prioritization (feature → outcome)
- Built velocity tracking systems grounded in metrics
- Established recurring forums (stakeholder forums, AdCo groups, monthly cadences)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Could discuss more about measuring process effectiveness
- Less detail on how she iterated on processes that weren't working

### 🌱 Org Building / People Management

**Grade:** A-

**Assessment:** Strong evidence of building teams from scratch and establishing structure; some gaps in discussing IC development

**Evidence:**

> I was the first product manager. So I came in with, like, kind of the engineers were just running the show... I came into bringing some clarity to that roadmap.

> Once we were able to get more resources higher over time, we knew that our next hire. So I was able to bring in a platform product manager. This is a person I brought over from [previous company], and she helped with that... and then my next product manager was truly focused on the real estate agent experience.

> My team would definitely say that I am an authentic leader. That I am truly lead human first... I always wanted to prevent burnout. It was never at the cost of the team.

> I'm really proud of a lot of the product managers that have come through my leadership and where they've gone after.

- Built product organization from 1 PM (herself) to multi-PM team aligned to pillars
- Scaled real estate vertical from 7 engineers to larger team over 5 years

**Strengths:**

- Proven ability to build from scratch (first PM → multi-PM team)
- Thoughtful about hiring sequence (platform PM first, then agent experience PM)
- Human-first leadership philosophy focused on preventing burnout
- Pride in developing PMs who advanced in their careers

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Limited specific examples of coaching/developing ICs
- Could discuss more about performance management or tough conversations
- Didn't go deep on how she assessed talent or made hiring decisions

### 🤝 Influence

**Grade:** A-

**Assessment:** Good evidence of stakeholder management and cross-functional influence; received feedback about speaking up earlier

**Evidence:**

> My strategy for that... this is really bringing key stakeholders into a room together, right? And talking about, what is it we're trying to accomplish holistically for the business and for our customers and getting alignment there.

> One of the most important pieces of performance feedback was from our CTO... you would have a lot more credibility if you actually spoke up sooner. It's like anytime you speak up, you have great ideas. But you always come in too late.

> Work with all your stakeholders, get to know all your stakeholders, build relationships with them, understand their perspective of why they do what they do and what makes their business run.

> It's like you get to know some of the sales reps. At the end of the day, everybody's a human, and you just build that relationship.

- Created stakeholder forums to get alignment on outcomes vs. features
- Transformed sales-led organization to product-led by building relationships with sellers

**Strengths:**

- Creates structured forums for stakeholder alignment
- Builds relationships across functions (sales, engineering, executives)
- Understands different stakeholder motivations (quotas, priorities)
- Self-aware about growth area (speaking up earlier) and working on it

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Received feedback about not speaking up early enough in executive settings
- Limited examples of influencing upward to executives
- Could demonstrate more about managing conflict or difficult stakeholders

## Product Leadership Competencies

*PM fundamentals that matter ongoing*

### 🧭 Direction

**Grade:** A

**Assessment:** Strong evidence of translating vision into strategy and roadmaps; clear multi-pillar approach

**Evidence:**

> He had a vision for making transaction rooms a true hub for agents and for sellers and buyers... And even his grander vision, which was like the multi year vision, was also eventually being able to take that data into the next state of closing, a mortgage closing.

> The major pillars that we broke it down to were: platform delivery, administration, agent experience, and consumer. Each of those different pillars has a different outcome that that role has to get completed.

> For each of the themes, it really started with getting an understanding of that Persona. Right. And the job that needed to be done.

- Transformed founder's vision into structured product pillars with clear outcomes
- Grew real estate vertical from $50M to $180M over 5 years through multi-product roadmap
- Identified MLS forms as strategic unlock that required building BD team

**Strengths:**

- Clear methodology for breaking down vision into actionable pillars
- Outcome-oriented thinking (JTBD for each persona)
- Strategic insight on what drove growth ($50M → $180M)
- Able to translate vision into org structure (pillars → teams)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Less evidence of creating original vision vs. translating existing vision
- Could discuss more about strategic trade-offs or bets that didn't work

### 💡 Insight

**Grade:** B+

**Assessment:** Solid evidence of customer understanding through structured processes; less depth on discovery methodology

**Evidence:**

> I had to even bring structure into customer conversations and research. Like it was. They weren't having those real conversations to understand how are customers actually using this?

> I didn't need to meet with the CEO of Keller Williams. I needed to meet with the brokers at the individual offices.

> We would also pick out customers that we were trying to get right. So they were opportunities. We didn't get them yet. We're like, hey, why don't you come in, give us some feedback.

> My favorite is when you would get the brokers arguing with each other. Like, that's silly. Why would you want that? Because then they're like, they're solutioning together and you're learning.

- Established AdCo (advisory customer) groups that didn't exist for real estate vertical
- Rotated customer voices to get diverse perspectives from different markets

**Strengths:**

- Built customer research processes where none existed
- Understood right level to engage (operators vs. executives)
- Created structures for ongoing customer input (AdCo groups)
- Valued diverse perspectives (rotation, opportunities as well as current customers)

**Gaps/Areas for Improvement:**

- Limited discussion of discovery methodology or validation techniques
- Could demonstrate deeper qualitative research skills
- Didn't discuss how insights translated to specific product decisions beyond forms

## Overall Assessment

Aida demonstrates strong fit for the Director of Product role, with particular strength in the Builder/Operator competencies critical for Year 1 success at Digible.

**Strongest Areas:**
- **⚙️ Execution / Org Process (A)**: This is her stated "sweet spot" and the evidence confirms it. She has a clear methodology for creating operating rhythms, stakeholder forums, and measurement systems. The velocity tracking example shows she doesn't just create process, she creates process grounded in data.
- **🧭 Direction (A)**: Strong evidence of translating vision into structured execution. The pillar-based approach with outcome-oriented thinking is exactly what Digible needs. The $50M → $180M growth demonstrates she knows how to identify strategic levers.
- **🌱 Org Building (A-)**: Proven ability to build from scratch (first PM → team), though could go deeper on IC development.

**Growth Areas:**
- **🤝 Influence (A-)**: Self-aware about tendency to observe rather than speak up early. Has worked on this ("I couldn't be the quiet one in the room"). Something to validate with references.
- **💡 Insight (B+)**: Built good customer research infrastructure but less evidence of sophisticated discovery methodology. Adequate for role but not a differentiator.

**Cultural Fit:**
Her explicit excitement about Digible's challenges ("Those are actually the reasons I do want the job") and her human-first leadership philosophy align well with the organization's values. Her response about the 4-day work week context suggests she'd appreciate the culture Reed has built.

## Key Takeaways

- Builder/Operator is her explicit sweet spot — 20+ years of consistent pattern
- DocuSign experience highly relevant: first PM, built team, $50M → $180M growth
- Strong process builder: stakeholder forums, AdCo groups, velocity tracking
- Self-aware about growth area (speaking up earlier) and actively working on it
- Human-first leadership philosophy focused on preventing burnout
- Energized by Digible's exact challenges (org maturity, talent density, high expectations)

## Suggested Follow-up Questions

- Tell me about a time when a process you established wasn't working. How did you recognize it and what did you do?
- Can you give me a specific example of coaching or developing a PM on your team?
- Describe a situation where you had to influence an executive who disagreed with your recommendation. How did you handle it?
- What's your approach to discovery and validation when entering a new domain you're unfamiliar with?
- How do you balance speaking up early (per CTO feedback) with your natural tendency to observe and listen first?
