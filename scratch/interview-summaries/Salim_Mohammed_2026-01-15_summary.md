*Critical for Year 1 success - building the machine*

### ⚙️ Execution / Org Process

**Grade:** B+

**Assessment:** Solid evidence of delivery and process building, particularly in 0-to-1 contexts; less explicit focus on operating rhythms

**Evidence:**

> The CPO was hired, I think, like, six months before me. So she was essentially tasked to create a product team and actually, like, bring some order to the organization and bring some kind of predictability and process.

> It was really about, how do you essentially turn this into a product org, rather than an org that just sells imagery and roof reports.

> We got to, like, 21 POCs with insurance carriers... 15 started and like three completed... And then we had like two in contracting, one signed.

## Product Leadership Competencies

*PM fundamentals that matter ongoing*

### 🧭 Direction

**Grade:** A

**Assessment:** Strong evidence of creating strategy from ambiguity; clear 0-to-1 product thinking

**Evidence:**

> How do you turn, like, a research project into a kind of acquisition that was like, needed to figure out how to make revenue from it... How would you then turn that into an actual product?

> Essentially, it's like, how do you take the data... create a new revenue stream and either sell it to similar customers or replace what they're doing with a higher end product?

> First thing was customer conversations... I counted. I did 26 trips. So roughly every two weeks I was in the air... trying to get that input, but also pitching some sort of vision.

> In some of these meetings, pitching some sort of vision. Here's what we have. This is what we believe. How it would be useful for your specific part of the market... Does this resonate?

> How do we actually get that validation? How do we actually make sure we think of something and fix the issues before fingers are on keyboards to code it.

## Overall Assessment

Salim demonstrates strong fit for the Director of Product role, with particular differentiation in the Product Leadership competencies (Direction and Insight). His 0-to-1 experience and deep customer discovery habits are notable strengths.

**Strongest Areas:**
- **💡 Insight (A)**: Exceptional customer discovery (26 trips in a year, conventions, direct customer engagement). This is a differentiator — he clearly values being in the field.
- **🧭 Direction (A)**: Strong 0-to-1 strategic thinking. Created product strategy from ambiguous acquisitions at Eagle View and Paradigm. Identifies workflow disruption opportunities.
- **🤝 Influence (A-)**: Comfortable at executive level; earns trust by demonstrating deep business understanding.

**Areas that could be explored further:**
- **⚙️ Execution / Org Process (B+)**: Solid but less explicit about operating rhythms and predictability mechanisms. More focused on strategy than execution mechanics.
- **🌱 Org Building (B+)**: Built teams but less depth on coaching/developing PMs.

**Key Consideration:**
Salim's strength is in 0-to-1 product creation and customer discovery. The question is whether Digible needs someone who excels at *creating* direction from ambiguity (Salim's strength) or *translating* existing direction into execution (more Aida's profile). Given Digible's stated clear vision needing strategic execution, this is worth considering.

**Motivation context:**
He mentioned being "opportunistic" and that things at his current company are "moving slower than I would like." This suggests he may be push-motivated as much as pull-motivated.
