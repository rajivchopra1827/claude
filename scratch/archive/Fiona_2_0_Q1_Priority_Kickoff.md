> **Important**

> The goal is to give the team enough direction and clarity to move forward, and allow this to evolve as our shared understanding evolves.

> **Under Construction**
> - Some DRIs from consulted teams still TBD (Data Platform, CS, PMT, Organic, Growth, Finance)
> - Specific Q1 proxy metric baselines need validation

## 🎯 Why We're Here

Our reporting doesn't give clients a clear, confident understanding of performance or direction. It's a reactive readout of marketing metrics rather than proactive multifamily strategy. This weakens client confidence, forces AMs to compensate with workarounds, and makes us vulnerable to competitors like StreetDigitalAI and PERQ Pulse who are delivering stronger storytelling.

Meanwhile, Fiona is no longer something clients (or us) point to as a differentiator. If we don't evolve now, we risk losing the confidence of our clients that we are tech leaders and experts in multifamily marketing.

- **Help apartment marketers ("Who"):** Our clients—property marketers, regional managers, and portfolio leaders at PMCs who need to understand and optimize their marketing performance
- **Hit their goals and feel confident ("What"):** Move from reactive "what happened" to proactive "what to do next" so clients can hit occupancy targets and demonstrate ROI to their clients
- **By providing marketing intelligence built for multifamily ("How"):** Evolve Fiona into an AI-powered strategist that translates marketing metrics into multifamily outcomes (leads, leases, occupancy, ROI)

</details>

### Vision (1-Year Horizon)

Fiona 2.0 is the AI-powered marketing assistant built for multifamily—a redesigned reporting experience that tells a clear multifamily story with proactive AI insights, trusted budget recommendations, and an interface that makes our AMs and clients feel confident we're leading them to success.

By EOY 2026:
- Reporting CSAT has increased from 2.5 → 4.5 (Alpha) and 4.3 → 4.5+ (Broad)
- AMs are equipped to be account strategists, not just account managers
- Fiona is again cited as a key differentiator in sales conversations
- Clients see the full marketing → multifamily story in one unified experience

## 📊 What Success Looks Like

### Business Metrics

| Metric | Definition of Success | Commentary |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| $ Agency Expansion Revenue | +$750k Gross MRR by EOY (+250 properties @ $3k deal-size) | Proactive storytelling & recommendations → higher CSAT → more expansion |
| # New Agency PMCs | Close X additional PMCs (target TBD) | Fiona 2.0 becomes a differentiator again, driving buzz and closing more new business |

### Proxy Metrics

| Metric | Definition of Success | Commentary |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| Reporting CSAT (Alpha - Willow Bridge) | Increase from 2.5 → 4.5 | Direct measure of client confidence improvement with our most engaged alpha |
| Reporting CSAT (Internal) | Increase from X → 4.5 | AMs get to curate & refine the story vs generating it themselves |
| Reporting CSAT (Broad) | Increase from 4.3 → 4.5+ | Last measured: only 63 of ~600+ responded—need broader adoption |
| % New Business Close Rate | Increase from X% → Y% | Fiona 2.0 as differentiator helps close more deals |

## 🎲 Strategy

**How we'll get there:**

1. **Marketing → Multifamily Story:** Show how marketing drives multifamily outcomes (leads, leases, occupancy, ROI) by integrating PMS/CRM data

2. **Reporting Redesign:** High-signal, simplified reporting directly in the native Fiona experience—moving from dense data-dumps to clear storytelling

3. **Fiona AI:** Evolve from reactive read-outs to proactive storytelling & strategy via AI-powered executive summaries, insights, and recommendations

4. **Fiona Budgets 2.0:** Rebuild budget recommendations to be trusted, explainable, and actionable—showing clients how to shift spend to hit their goals

---

## 🔬 Scope

**✅ In Scope:**
- Changes to client-facing reporting (what clients see, how they interact with it)
- Changes to internal reporting workflows (how AMs prepare for and deliver client conversations)
- New data integrations and pipelines (bringing PMS/CRM data into our reporting stack)
- AI/ML model development (powering insights, summaries, and recommendations)
- UX/UI redesign work (modernizing reporting experience within Fiona)
- Change management and rollout (training, adoption, feedback loops with CS)

**❌ Out of Scope:**
- Custom/bespoke client-specific reports (we're building opinionated, unified intelligence)
- AI-powered customer service (clients expect human experts)
- Full end-to-end marketing automation (that's the AEP priority)
- Non-multifamily verticals (Student/Senior)
- Migration of all internal dashboards (focus on client-facing first)

## ⏭️ Q1 Focus

### What We're Committing To

| Initiative | Description | Target |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Property Report: Marketing → Multifamily Story | Connect marketing metrics to leads/leases/occupancy using PMS data. Show the full funnel so clients understand ROI. | End of Q1 |
| Portfolio Report: Property Health | Roll-up view showing occupancy, targets, and trends so AMs & clients know which properties need attention | End of Q1 |
| PMS Data Quality Validation | POC with Alpha (Willow Bridge) to validate accuracy of attribution data we have from CRM | Mid-Q1 |
| Expand Alpha Beyond Willow Bridge | Bring additional PMCs into the Alpha program to broaden validation | End of Q1 |

### What We Need to Learn *(exploratory)*

| Question | How We'll Answer It |
|----------|---------------------|
| Is attribution data in CRMs accurate enough to tell marketing → multifamily story? | POC with Alpha to assess data quality; identify gaps |
| What fallback exists if attribution data is unreliable? | Explore "buy" solutions (HyLy) or "build" solutions (own match-back) |
| What does the right engagement model with PMT/Organic look like? | Discuss and align on milestone-based vs. standard EPD rituals |

### Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Bad attribution data in CRM makes marketing → multifamily impossible | Validation POC with Alpha; Fallback 1: Buy (HyLy); Fallback 2: Build (own match-back) |
| Not enough PM capacity | Rajiv & Paolo lean in; accelerate PM hiring via external contractor + dedicated hiring blocks |
| Data dependency slowing us down (context-sharing between Data Platform & Reporting Pod) | Options: Add DP member to RP, or have RP get own data initially (via API) → DP follows up |
| Rollout speed / change management through Agency | Pre-alignment with senior CS leadership |
| Request volume taking up team capacity | Reshape request process; have Agency do more triage/prioritization |
