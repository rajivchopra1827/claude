# Response to Jenny (Round 2)

Jenny - you're right that we're still in the SLT vacuum without a solid capacity picture. That's the core issue we need to solve.

**On capacity:**
What if we use the charters to surface the collision? Each P0 DRI puts rough resource needs in their charter (e.g., "needs 2 FTE from Agency"). When we stack them up, we'll see where we don't have enough people. That makes the constraint visible and forces the hard conversation.

**On P1/P2 already in flight:**
My vote: explicitly pause what's not critical to free up capacity for P0s. Better to slow things down and create space for what matters most than keep juggling everything. If Reed deemed it P2 but it's consuming capacity, that's capacity we don't have for P0s. Need to make that trade-off explicit.

**On kickoffs:**
Love the sign-up sheet idea. One thought - maybe do it in two phases:
1. Small kickoff team (5-8 people) to define the work first
2. Then broader team signs up for specific initiatives once it's scoped

That way you're not organizing 130 people before the work is defined.

You're right we're pushing for timing over setting teams up to succeed. Capacity picture needs to come first - charters can help surface it, but we need to accept what it tells us and make hard choices.

Appreciate you thinking through this.
