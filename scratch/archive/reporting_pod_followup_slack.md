# Reporting Pod Weekly Follow-up - Slack Message Options

## Variant A: Direct & Structured

@Paolo Bettoni sharing a bit of a download after today's Reporting Pod Weekly and cc'ing @Kelsey C-N so we can all collaborate on moving it forward :slightly_smiling_face:

I suspect this isn't new/news, but wanted to name a few things I'm observing from today's conversation:

**What I'm seeing:**
• **Unstructured and somewhat incoherent:** It's not clear what people are doing, why they're doing it, or how it all fits together into driving cohesive value delivery.
• **Overly stuck in technical worlds:** We're deep in implementation details but struggling to ground around basics like: "we're trying to deliver X feature, for Y audience, by Z date"
• **Like we're losing the plot week to week:** We've been looking at the same designs and talking about leads/leases data for ~6 weeks, and yet in this meeting I still heard things like "we're just now realizing we need X" or "I need finalized designs," which is confusing since we'd previously discussed that designs will likely change but a lot of the core data-points (ex: leads, leases) will be expected.

**The meeting structure feels like a symptom:** We spent ~45 minutes on rollout that Kelsey is already putting into an artifact, rather than using that artifact to drive crisp decisions and move on.

I'm not sure yet what the most productive way to re-engage is, but wanted to surface the desire for clarity on:
• What are we actually shipping, to whom, and when?
• Are we on track to deliver against our broader goals as a team?
• Using this weekly time to review progress against a clear plan and unblock decisions, not re-litigate context or rediscover the same needs.

I know @Kelsey C-N you're just jumping in and already working on the rollout plan—I'm hoping we can use that as a foundation to bring more structure to how we run these meetings and what we're driving toward. Happy to chat through how we might approach this together.

## Variant B: Collaborative & Solution-Oriented

@Paolo Bettoni @Kelsey C-N sharing some observations from today's Reporting Pod Weekly—would love your thoughts on how we can tighten things up :slightly_smiling_face:

**What I noticed today:**
• The conversation felt unstructured—hard to track what we're building, why, and how it connects to our goals
• We're deep in technical details but missing the basics: "What are we shipping? Who's it for? When?"
• After ~6 weeks of discussing the same designs and data (leads/leases), we're still hearing "we're just now realizing we need X" or "I need finalized designs"—feels like we're losing context week to week

**The symptom:** We spent ~45 minutes discussing rollout details that Kelsey is already documenting, rather than using that artifact to make decisions and move forward.

**What I'd love to see:**
• Clear answers to: What are we shipping? To whom? By when?
• Weekly check-ins that review progress against a plan and unblock decisions, not rediscover needs
• Confidence that we're on track against our broader team goals

I know @Kelsey C-N you're just getting started and already building the rollout plan—I'm thinking we could use that as a foundation to restructure how we run these meetings. Paolo, would love your perspective on what's working and what we could improve.

Happy to sync on this whenever works for you both.

## Variant C: Reflective & Forward-Looking

@Paolo Bettoni @Kelsey C-N wanted to share some reflections from today's Reporting Pod Weekly and see how we can work together to tighten things up :slightly_smiling_face:

**Observations:**
Today's conversation highlighted a few patterns I've been noticing:
• **Lack of structure:** It's unclear what we're building, why, and how pieces fit together
• **Missing the forest for the trees:** Deep in implementation but struggling with basics like "what are we shipping, to whom, by when?"
• **Context loss:** After ~6 weeks on the same designs/data, we're still rediscovering needs we'd already discussed

The ~45 minutes we spent on rollout details (that Kelsey is already documenting) felt symptomatic—we were rehashing rather than using the artifact to drive decisions.

**What I'm hoping for:**
I'd love our weekly time to focus on:
• Clear answers to: What are we shipping? To whom? By when?
• Progress reviews against a plan, not context rediscovery
• Confidence we're on track to deliver value

I know @Kelsey C-N you're just jumping in and already building the rollout plan—I'm thinking we could use that as a foundation to bring more structure to these meetings. Paolo, would love your thoughts on what's working and where we could improve.

Open to chat through this whenever works for you both.
