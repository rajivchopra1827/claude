# Agency → EPD Request Process

*For EPD staff discussion*

---

## The Problem

No clear process for Agency requests to EPD. Teams spending 30-50% of capacity on ad-hoc requests without visibility, prioritization, or tracking.

**Evidence:**
- 100-150 requests/month via FreshDesk (peaked 200+ in July)
- ~50% are user errors, not real issues (Sept: 26 requests, 13 were "foops")
- Request mix: ~33-50% bugs, remainder features
- Reporting pod: 1/6 to 1/3 of capacity on support
- Agency Enablement: ~40% of time on requests

---

## Why This Hurts

**EPD Teams:**
- Requests scattered across channels (Slack, email, FreshDesk)
- Missing context to act — no shared framework for what info is needed
- Can't distinguish urgent from noise, real issues from user errors
- Constant interruptions (especially reporting week)

**EPD Leadership:**
- No visibility into volume, patterns, or trends
- Requests evaluated 1-by-1 without shared prioritization
- Teams operating as service org vs. product org

**Agency Teams:**
- Don't know where to send requests or what context to provide
- No visibility into status or queue
- *(Need to validate with Jenny, Shannon, Kelly)*

## Proposed Solution (This is a solved problem)

**Core components:**
1. **Single intake channel** — Linear with Slack-based submission
2. **Required fields** — What, why, urgency, revenue impact (enables routing + triage)
3. **Smart routing** — Requests go to right team AND right bucket (small vs. big, bug vs. feature)
4. **Shared triage** — EPD + Agency partners collaborate (not just EPD alone)
5. **Different cadences by type:**
   - Small requests/bugs: Continuous or weekly triage by team
   - Bigger strategic requests: Monthly review cross-functionally
6. **Status visibility** — Queue visible to both sides, SLA for response

**What's in flight:**
- Draft tracker for bigger requests exists (needs formalization)
- Figma diagram showing Submit → Triage → Refine → Prioritize flow

**Where we left off (Dec 2025):**
- Technical approach decided: Single triage bucket with leadership rotation (Linear Business plan)
- Not yet implemented — no owner, no defined triage process by type

## What We Need to Decide

1. **Priority:** Is this worth doing this quarter vs. other process work?
2. **Ownership:** Who drives implementation? *(Candidate: Kelsey)*
3. **Scope:** All pods or pilot with one? *(Recommend: pilot with Reporting)*

**If yes, rough timeline:**
- Weeks 1-2: Set up Linear intake + forms
- Weeks 3-4: Pilot with one team, iterate
- Week 5+: Roll out to other pods
