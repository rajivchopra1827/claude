# Feedback for Kelsey Rose - Director of Product Role

## 1. Cross-Functional Influence with Resistant Stakeholders

When we discussed your "kryptonite," you mentioned getting frustrated when working with stakeholders who aren't ready to evolve. This role involves a lot of change management with resistant stakeholders, and we felt that dynamic might not set you up for success here.

## 2. Experience Quickly Ramping in New Contexts

Going into the interview, we were curious about how your experience would translate to quickly stepping into an unfamiliar environment. What we learned is that your success at GoFormz was really built on deep, intimate knowledge of a single product over many years - which is a strength, but different from what this role requires. We needed someone who has demonstrated the ability to ramp quickly in contexts they didn't build from scratch.
