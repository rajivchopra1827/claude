# SLT Update to Team

Hey team - quick update from today's SLT conversations:

**What happened:**
We didn't get to review the charters you put together (they're great, btw). The conversation ended up focusing on a bigger question: how do we approach planning and kickoffs given capacity constraints and the amount of uncertainty we're sitting in.

**Where we landed:**
A few tensions surfaced that we need to work through as a leadership team:
- We're being asked for high-fidelity plans upfront, but we're moving fast with a lot of ambiguity
- We need capacity clarity before we can commit to deliverables, and we don't have that yet
- There's work already in flight (P1/P2) that's consuming capacity we might need for P0s

**What this means:**
We're not ready to kick off priorities yet. We need to:
1. Get a clearer capacity picture (the charters can help with this - they show resource needs)
2. Make explicit decisions about what's in flight vs. what we're pausing
3. Align SLT on the approach before we bring teams in

**Next steps:**
- Leadership team working through capacity and prioritization approach
- Will loop back once we have clarity on what we're actually kicking off and when
- Your charter work isn't wasted - it's helpful for surfacing resource needs

Appreciate your patience as we work through this. I know it's frustrating to have things in flux.
