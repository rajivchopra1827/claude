## Discussion Topics

| Topic | Challenge | Proposal | Decision Needed |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Capacity & Scope** | EPD cannot support P1s beyond P0s in Q1. May not have capacity for all P0s (POST active but marked Q2). | **P0s:** Company-wide commitment<br>**P1s:** Autonomous teams only, no cross-functional support<br>**P2s:** Q2+ | Confirm P0/P1/P2 scope by function. Resolve POST timing. |
| **Tracking Level** | 99 initiatives in Q1 is unworkable. Inconsistent granularity, redundant items. Initiative-level tracking insufficient. | Track at **milestone level** (quarterly/monthly). Teams own initiatives under milestones. Prefer outcome/proxy metrics. | Adopt milestone-level tracking vs initiative micromanagement. |
| **Team Composition** | Unclear who defines cross-functional teams for each P0. Need actual responsibilities, not generic statements. | Decide who defines teams and when. Sanction kickoff template (mission, metrics, milestones, roles, cadence). | Who defines teams? When? Who owns kickoffs? |
| **Change Velocity** | Property Health Report: 6 weeks for one data point. Three root causes:<br>**1. No clear owner** — diffused accountability, liaison model failing<br>**2. No permission to act** — willing people lack mandate; culture/incentives favor caution<br>**3. No urgency** — no explicit targets, so default to smallest step + excess meetings | **1. Single DRI** per dept per priority<br>**2. Dept leads empower** their DRI with explicit mandate to drive change<br>**3. Milestone tracker** with committed dates creates urgency | Dept leads: Who is your DRI for each P0? Will you empower them to drive change? Commit to milestone dates in tracker? |
| **POST ≠ Standalone Priority** | POST is a P0, but it's really a component of "Modify Organic Offerings." No PM yet, no clarity on unified offer (tech + people), GTM, or pricing/packaging. Starting with tech before defining the business model is "starting at the wrong end." | POST sits under "Modify Organic Offerings." Define the unified offer first (what we sell, how tech + people fit together), then tech enables it. | Does SLT agree POST = part of "Modify Organic Offerings"? Who owns defining the unified offer? |
| **Partnerships vs CS Ownership** | No clear criteria for which dept owns which relationships. Zumper = partner (clear). Graystar = Partnerships due to billing, but fundamentally a customer. Large PMCs = unclear. Matters for POST rollout. | Define ownership criteria (e.g., partner = unique integration/billing; customer = CS regardless of size). | What's the rule? Who owns Graystar, large PMCs? |

## Decisions Required

1. **Scope:** Confirm P0/P1/P2 by function; resolve POST timing
2. **Tracking:** Milestone-level vs initiative-level
3. **Teams:** Who defines cross-functional teams and when
4. **Accountability:** Empowered DRIs per dept with mandate/authority
5. **POST:** Acknowledge as part of "Modify Organic Offerings"; who owns unified offer?
6. **Ownership:** Partnerships vs CS criteria for relationships
