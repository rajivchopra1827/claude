Aida,

Thank you for your thoughtful note. I'm glad our conversation resonated with you, and I appreciate you taking the time to reflect on what we discussed.

Your description of yourself as a builder-operator—someone who thrives when vision is clear but execution needs focus and clarity—is exactly the profile we're looking for. The fact that you're energized by the organizational maturity work ahead, rather than intimidated by it, tells me a lot about your fit for this role. That's the kind of ownership mindset that will be essential for success here.

I've reviewed your brief and 30/60/90 day plan, and I'm impressed by how you've already translated our conversation into a concrete approach. Your experience scaling the real estate vertical at DocuSign—taking it from a single product to a multi-product portfolio and growing revenue from $50M to $180M—demonstrates exactly the kind of strategic execution we need.

I'd like to move forward with next steps. We'll be scheduling conversations with a few other team members so you can get a fuller picture of the organization and the role. [Name/Devik] will be reaching out shortly to coordinate those meetings.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Best,
Rajiv
