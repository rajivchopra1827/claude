# Slack Message Variants - Engagement Needs Draft

## Variant A: Concise & Action-Oriented

📋 **Request: Engagement Needs Draft**

Need a quick draft from each of you outlining engagement requirements for Fiona 2.0 posts, post strategy, and AI fulfillment to prep for tomorrow's SLT conversation on cross-functional teams.

**What I need:**
• Teams/people across the agency who need to be engaged for each priority
• Level of engagement needed (high/medium/low or specific description)
• Specific names if you have them in mind

**Framework to use:**
1. Which teams need to be engaged?
2. What level of engagement do we need from them?
3. Any specific people in mind?

**Context:** This helps Aaron, Paolo, and me build the right cross-functional teams for Q1+. We're using this as an opportunity to establish a deeper collaboration model—moving beyond the single agency liaison approach (which worked well but couldn't fully drive influence/change management). The more explicit we can be about change management needs, the better equipped we'll be to propose the right level of collaboration.

**Deadline:** ASAP (conversation is tomorrow)

## Variant B: Balanced with Context

🤝 **Building Cross-Functional Teams - Input Needed**

Hey @Kelsey @JD @Megan — need your help putting together a quick draft on engagement needs for our three priorities (Fiona 2.0 posts, post strategy, AI fulfillment).

**The ask:**
For each priority, I'd love a "shitty first draft" covering:
• Which teams/people across the agency need to be engaged
• What level of engagement we'll need from them
• Specific names if you have someone in mind

**Why this matters:**
Aaron, Paolo, and I are meeting with the rest of SLT tomorrow to build cross-functional teams for each priority. Having your input on engagement needs will help us structure these teams effectively.

**The bigger picture:**
This is an opportunity to establish a new working model with our agency partners. The agency liaison role was a good first step, but we've learned (like with Fiona + Nate) that success often requires deeper collaboration than one person can provide. Past liaisons have done great work, but haven't always been able to fully drive the influence and change management needed.

**What would help most:**
Even if you don't have specific names, describing what the *ideal* person would be able to do (especially around change management and influence) will help us set clear expectations with stakeholders about the level of collaboration needed.

**Timeline:** ASAP — conversation is tomorrow

## Variant C: Reflective & Opportunity-Focused

💡 **Opportunity: Deeper Collaboration Model**

@Kelsey @JD @Megan — I'd love your input on something that will help shape how we work with agency partners going forward.

**The immediate ask:**
Can you each put together a quick draft (don't overthink it—"shitty first draft" is perfect) outlining:
• Which teams/people across the agency need to be engaged for Fiona 2.0 posts, post strategy, and AI fulfillment
• What level of engagement we'll need from each
• Specific people if names come to mind

**The context:**
Aaron, Paolo, and I are going into a conversation with the rest of SLT tomorrow to build cross-functional teams for each of these priorities. Your perspective on engagement needs will be crucial.

**Why I'm framing it this way:**
We've seen that initiatives like Fiona required deeper collaboration than our agency liaison model could provide (Nate being a great example of someone we needed to work closely with). While our past liaisons have been excellent, they haven't always been able to fully drive the influence and change management throughout the organization that these strategies require.

This feels like an opportunity to establish a new working model—one where we're more explicit about what success actually requires. Rather than having too many cooks in the kitchen, I'd rather we be slightly over-resourced and set clear expectations about the level of change management and collaboration needed.

**What would be most helpful:**
Even if specific names don't come to mind, describing what an ideal collaborator would be able to do (especially around driving influence and change) will help us go into tomorrow's conversation equipped to propose the right level of collaboration.

Thanks! 🙏
