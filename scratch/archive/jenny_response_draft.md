# Response to Jenny: Plan of Attack for Notion Clarity

## Context Synthesis

From the **SLT Regroup** meeting:
- Notion database set up, all DRIs need to clarify initiative definitions and team commitments by **Thursday**
- 6 P0 priorities identified, but many lack sufficient definition
- Follow-up meeting scheduled for Thursday to finalize Q1 commitments

From the **Digible priorities alignment** conversation:
- Core tension: Trying to define everything before starting (waterfall) vs. getting started with clarity on outcomes
- Proposed shift: **Kick off priorities by Thursday** with milestone-driven outcomes, not complete initiative definitions
- Solution framework: Focus on 3-5 priorities with clear quarterly milestones rather than detailed initiative plans
- Fiona 2.0 charter serves as template for other priorities

## Plan of Attack: Driving Clarity Before Next Week

### The Shift in Approach

Rather than trying to fill out complete initiative definitions in Notion (which is causing the waterfall planning problem), we're shifting to **milestone-driven kickoffs** that give teams enough clarity to start while acknowledging we'll learn and adapt.

### Three-Part Plan

#### 1. **By Thursday: Priority-Level Clarity** (Not detailed initiatives)

Each P0 DRI fills out a **kickoff charter** (using Fiona 2.0 as template) that includes:
- **Mission & Vision**: Why this priority matters, what success looks like
- **Q1 Milestones**: 1-2 key milestones per priority (not all initiatives)
  - Example: "Property Report showing marketing → multifamily story by end of Q1"
- **Resource Needs**: Who needs to be involved and at what level (DRI, Contributors, Consulted)
- **Key Risks & Dependencies**: What could block us, what we need from others
- **What We're Committing To**: Clear outcomes, not detailed task lists
- **What We Need to Learn**: Exploratory questions we'll answer as we go

**This goes in Notion** but at the **priority level**, not initiative level.

#### 2. **Thursday Meeting: Alignment & Kickoffs**

- Review priority charters (not initiative details)
- Align on which 3-5 priorities we're committing to as stretch goals
- Confirm resource allocations at the team level (not individual initiative level)
- **Kick off the priorities** - teams can start working with this level of clarity

#### 3. **Next Week: Teams Define Initiatives Bottom-Up**

- Teams working on each priority define specific initiatives as they understand the work better
- Initiatives get added to Notion as they're defined (not all upfront)
- Monthly reviews track progress at milestone level, not initiative level

### What This Achieves

✅ **Clarity without waterfall**: Teams know what outcomes to drive toward without needing complete initiative definitions upfront

✅ **Starts momentum**: We're moving by Thursday instead of waiting for perfect plans

✅ **Adaptive planning**: Initiatives emerge from work, not from trying to predict everything

✅ **Notion stays useful**: Priority-level clarity is documented, initiatives get added as they're defined

### The Template

Fiona 2.0 charter is the model - it shows:
- Clear mission/vision
- Q1 milestones (not all 33 initiatives)
- Resource needs and dependencies
- What we're committing to vs. what we're exploring
- Risks and mitigations

Other priorities can follow this same structure.

## Response to Jenny

Hey hey - woooee! What a convo today :lolsob:

**:mirror: Our Reflection**

Aaron/Paolo/me reflected on the conversation and there's a few tensions we're sitting in:

1. **High-fidelity plans vs. short timelines** - Plan precision should match understanding precision, and right now our understanding is still forming
2. **Leadership defining plans vs. teams owning them** - We can define the "what/why," but teams are closest to the work and need to own the "how"
3. **Ambition vs. capacity** - No confidence we can do all P0s, yet we're still talking about all of them. Planning subtractively makes every "no" feel like a loss; planning additively makes every stretch a win
4. **Certainty upfront vs. learning through doing** - We can't know exactly what we'll deliver until we start. Certainty comes from doing, not more planning

**Questions I'm sitting with:**
- How do we accept constraints and narrow to what's actually possible, so we can start?
- How do we bring teams in sooner so they own the "how" while we own the "what/why"?
- How do we as leadership operate at the outcomes/milestones level and let teams define initiatives?

**:black_right_pointing_double_triangle_with_vertical_bar: A hypothesis we're exploring**
- Focus on P0s only - ignore P1/P2 for now
- Each P0 DRI creates a light charter (example template) with mission, Q1 milestones, and resource needs - not detailed initiatives
- Kick off with teams so they define initiatives bottom-up
- Track at milestone level, not initiative level

We'd know it's working if by Thursday each P0 has a charter and teams are ready to kick off - and by next week teams are actively moving, not waiting for more planning.

Curious what you're seeing and if any of this resonates.
