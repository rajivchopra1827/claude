## Open Questions / Gaps

### Who (DRIs to be assigned)

Each team below needs a **single DRI** with the mandate to drive change. See [2026 Priorities SLT Sync](https://www.notion.so/digible/2026-Priorities-SLT-Sync-2f5e6112fa50808ab740ee4cf24f809d) for context on empowering DRIs.

| Team | Notes on What We Need |
|------|----------------------|
| **Organic** | Immersed in AI, thinks outside the box of "how things work today", able to influence change across Organic. Needs permission to make changes to how we price, package, and service core organic offers for GBP & Social. |
| **Data Platform** | Point of contact for data/media management |
| **App Platform** | Point of contact for AI infrastructure and native product |
| **Partnerships** | Point of contact for Zumper relationship |
| **Growth** | Point of contact for direct sales and product marketing |
| **CS** | Point of contact for post-adoption relationship management |
| **Finance** | Point of contact for billing, contracts, and pricing advice |
| **Ops** | Point of contact if operational support is needed |

### Strategic Contingencies

Engagement levels may shift based on go-to-market decisions:

| If this happens... | Then these teams shift... |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Go direct to Greystar (or large PMC)** | CS → Heavy (dedicated support); Ops → Medium (onboarding); Finance → Medium (contracts/billing) |
| **Widespread direct sales** | Growth → Heavy (sales motion); CS → Heavy (support scale) |
| **Remain primarily Zumper partnership** | Partnerships → Heavy; CS/Growth stay Medium |

### Other Open Items

- [ ] Partnerships vs CS: If we go direct to Greystar, who is responsible for owning that relationship?
- [ ] CS: Are they the ones pitching existing clients on Posts?
- [ ] Posts as part of "Modify Organic Offerings": How does this charter align with the broader organic strategy? (See SLT Sync discussion)
- [ ] Scope and Outcome sections need to be filled from priorities database
