**Key Constraints:**
- **Organizational silos:** Poor communication lines across departments (EPD ↔ Agency teams, across Agency teams, even within teams like CS). Lack of operating mechanisms for cross-functional collaboration.
- **Difficulty saying no:** Hard time setting realistic expectations about what can be done well in a year → risk of "wounding 100 and killing none"
- **Under capacity:** EPD under capacity despite aggressive timelines
