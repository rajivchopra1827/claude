# Product Operating Model

## Purpose

The Product Operating Model (also called the Product Model) is a conceptual framework based on first principles that leading product companies use to consistently create technology-powered solutions that deliver value to customers and drive business results. It emphasizes achieving outcomes versus merely producing output.

## When to Use

- Transforming from project-based to product-based organization
- Establishing how product teams should work
- Defining product culture and principles
- Setting up empowered product teams
- Creating systems for product discovery and delivery
- Aligning product strategy, teams, and processes

## Key Components/Steps

### Three Dimensions of the Product Operating Model

#### 1. How Products are Built
- **Small, frequent, reliable releases**: Minimum once every 2 weeks, ideally continuously (CI/CD)
- **Benefits**:
  - Respond quickly to customer needs
  - Detect problems before customers do
  - Prove new capabilities deliver necessary value

#### 2. How Problems are Solved
- **Teams assigned problems, not features**: Teams get problems to solve and desired outcomes to achieve
- **Empowered teams**: People closest to technology and users (engineers, PMs, designers) decide on best solution
- **Solutions must be**:
  - **Valuable**: Customer will buy or choose to use
  - **Usable**: User can figure out how to use
  - **Feasible**: Engineers know how to solve with available resources
  - **Viable**: Works for business (marketing, sales, finance, legal, compliance)

#### 3. Deciding Which Problems to Solve
- **Product leaders decide**: PM, tech, and design leaders responsible for which problems to solve
- **Work with stakeholders**: Drive necessary changes across organization
- **Create**:
  - **Customer-centric product vision**: Strong, compelling vision describing future company is creating
  - **Insight-driven product strategy**: Identifies most critical problems to solve

### Five Product Concepts

#### 1. Product Culture
**Four central principles:**
- **Principles over Process**: Principles drive behaviors, process systematizes but can't replace principles
- **Trust over Control**: Empower teams rather than micromanage
- **Innovation over Predictability**: Prioritize learning and innovation
- **Learning over Failure**: Focus on outcomes and learning, not just avoiding failure

**Emphasis**: Products and outcomes rather than projects and dates

#### 2. Product Strategy
**Plan to achieve product vision while satisfying business objectives**

**Four central principles:**
- **Focus**: Pick most important goals that will make biggest impact
- **Powered by Insights**: Strategy depends on insights from data, customers, technology, industry
- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate data and reasoning behind decisions
- **Placing Bets**: Manage portfolio of risks by placing series of bets each quarter

**Decisions**: Usually made by product leaders vs distributed across stakeholders

#### 3. Product Teams
**Cross-functional, durable teams empowered to solve problems**

**Four essential principles:**
- **Empowerment**: Teams given problems to solve, empowered to find best solution
- **Outcomes over Output**: Teams exist to solve problems, not ship features
- **Sense of Ownership**: Teams responsible for something meaningful to customer and business
- **Collaboration**: Cross-functional team (PM, designer, engineers) work together

**Team composition**:
- **Product Managers**: Responsible for value and viability, accountable for outcomes
- **Product Designers**: Responsible for usability, accountable for customer experience
- **Tech Leads**: Responsible for feasibility, accountable for delivery
- **Product Leaders**: Managers providing coaching and strategic context

#### 4. Product Discovery
**How teams rapidly determine best solution to problems**

**Four important principles:**
- **Minimize waste**: Test ideas quickly to determine if solution is worth building
- **Assess product risks**: Evaluate value, usability, viability, feasibility risks early
- **Embrace rapid experimentation**: Use quantitative and qualitative techniques, create prototypes, run experiments
- **Test ideas responsibly**: Protect company and customers in experiments

#### 5. Product Delivery
**Process of building, testing, and deploying quality solutions**

**Four essential principles:**
- **Small, frequent, uncoupled releases**: Enable quick iteration and risk management
- **Instrumentation**: Products must be instrumented to determine how and if they're being used
- **Monitoring**: Strong monitoring to quickly detect issues
- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Tools enabling A/B testing and other deployment practices

## Key Principles

- **Outcomes over Output**: Focus on solving problems and achieving outcomes, not shipping features
- **Empowerment**: Teams closest to users and technology make decisions
- **Principles over Process**: Principles guide behavior, process supports but doesn't replace principles
- **Trust over Control**: Empower teams rather than micromanage
- **Innovation over Predictability**: Prioritize learning and innovation
- **Learning over Failure**: Focus on outcomes and learning
- **Focus**: Pick most important goals for biggest impact
- **Powered by Insights**: Strategy depends on insights from multiple sources
- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate reasoning behind decisions
- **Placing Bets**: Manage portfolio of risks with series of bets

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing projects with products**: Treating product work as temporary projects with fixed scope
- **Giving teams features instead of problems**: Prescribing solutions rather than empowering teams
- **Focusing on output over outcomes**: Measuring features shipped rather than problems solved
- **Lack of empowerment**: Not giving teams autonomy to find best solutions
- **Process over principles**: Creating rigid processes without underlying principles
- **Control over trust**: Micromanaging teams rather than empowering them
- **Predictability over innovation**: Prioritizing certainty over learning and innovation
- **Lack of strategic context**: Teams don't understand vision, strategy, or business objectives
- **Siloed teams**: Not fostering cross-functional collaboration
- **No instrumentation or monitoring**: Can't measure if products are achieving outcomes

## Related Frameworks

- **Continuous Discovery Habits**: Framework for product discovery practices
- **Product Strategy**: How to create insight-driven product strategy
- **Product Principles**: Organizational principles that guide product work
- **Team Maturity Assessment**: Framework for assessing team's maturity in product model
- **First 90 Days**: Framework for leaders transitioning into product organizations

## Example Use Cases

- **Transforming from project to product**: Establish product culture, create empowered teams, shift from feature requests to problem statements, implement discovery and delivery practices
- **Setting up new product team**: Define team composition (PM, designer, engineers), establish ownership area, provide strategic context, empower team to solve problems
- **Improving product discovery**: Implement rapid experimentation, assess product risks early, test ideas responsibly, minimize waste
- **Establishing product strategy**: Create customer-centric vision, develop insight-driven strategy, communicate transparently, place strategic bets
