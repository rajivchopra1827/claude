# Team Maturity Assessment

## Purpose

Team maturity assessment frameworks help evaluate how well product teams are operating, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. They provide a structured way to assess team capabilities, processes, and culture to guide development and transformation efforts.

## When to Use

- Assessing current state of product teams
- Identifying areas for improvement
- Planning team development initiatives
- Measuring progress over time
- Comparing teams across organization
- Guiding transformation to product operating model
- Onboarding assessment for new teams

## Key Components/Steps

### Assessment Dimensions

**Common dimensions assessed:**

1. **Product Discovery**
   - How well teams understand customer needs
   - Quality and frequency of user research
   - Experimentation and validation practices
   - Risk assessment and mitigation

2. **Product Delivery**
   - Release frequency and reliability
   - Quality and technical practices
   - Monitoring and instrumentation
   - Deployment infrastructure

3. **Product Strategy**
   - Clarity of vision and strategy
   - Strategic alignment
   - Focus and prioritization
   - Insight-driven decision making

4. **Team Empowerment**
   - Autonomy and decision-making authority
   - Strategic context provided
   - Cross-functional collaboration
   - Ownership and accountability

5. **Product Culture**
   - Principles over process
   - Trust over control
   - Innovation over predictability
   - Learning over failure

6. **Outcomes Focus**
   - Measuring outcomes vs outputs
   - Using data to drive decisions
   - Focus on business impact
   - Iteration based on results

### Maturity Levels

**Typical maturity progression:**

**Level 1: Initial/Ad-hoc**
- No formal processes
- Reactive approach
- Inconsistent practices
- Output-focused

**Level 2: Developing**
- Some processes in place
- Beginning to be proactive
- Practices emerging but inconsistent
- Starting to measure outcomes

**Level 3: Defined**
- Processes documented and followed
- Proactive approach
- Consistent practices
- Outcomes-focused

**Level 4: Managed**
- Processes optimized
- Data-driven decisions
- Continuous improvement
- Strong outcomes focus

**Level 5: Optimizing**
- Processes continuously refined
- Innovation and experimentation
- Excellence in outcomes
- Culture of learning

### Assessment Process

1. **Define assessment scope**
   - Which teams to assess
   - Which dimensions to evaluate
   - What maturity levels to use

2. **Gather data**
   - Team interviews
   - Process observation
   - Artifact review (roadmaps, PRDs, etc.)
   - Metrics and data analysis

3. **Evaluate maturity**
   - Score each dimension
   - Identify strengths and gaps
   - Compare to target state

4. **Create development plan**
   - Prioritize improvement areas
   - Define specific actions
   - Set targets and timelines

5. **Track progress**
   - Reassess periodically
   - Measure improvement
   - Adjust plan as needed

## Key Principles

- **Assess holistically**: Look at multiple dimensions, not just one area
- **Context matters**: Maturity looks different for different teams and stages
- **Focus on outcomes**: Assess whether teams achieve outcomes, not just follow process
- **Continuous improvement**: Maturity is a journey, not destination
- **Team-specific**: Different teams may be at different maturity levels
- **Data-driven**: Use evidence to assess, not just opinions
- **Action-oriented**: Assessment should lead to specific improvements

## Common Pitfalls

- **Focusing only on process**: Assessing whether teams follow process rather than achieve outcomes
- **One-size-fits-all**: Applying same maturity criteria to all teams regardless of context
- **Perfectionism**: Expecting all teams to be at highest maturity level
- **Not reassessing**: Doing assessment once and not tracking progress
- **Ignoring culture**: Focusing on processes but not cultural factors
- **Not involving teams**: Assessment done to teams rather than with teams
- **No action plan**: Assessing but not creating plan for improvement
- **Comparing teams unfairly**: Not accounting for different contexts and constraints
- **Focusing on outputs**: Measuring features shipped rather than problems solved
- **Ignoring strategic context**: Not assessing whether teams have needed context

## Related Frameworks

## Example Use Cases

- **Transformation assessment**: Evaluate current state before transforming to product operating model
- **Team development**: Identify what team needs to improve, create development plan
- **Progress tracking**: Reassess team periodically to measure improvement
- **Organizational benchmarking**: Compare maturity across teams to identify best practices
- **Onboarding assessment**: Evaluate new team's maturity to guide onboarding
