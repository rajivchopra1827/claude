# First 90 Days

## Purpose

The First 90 Days framework provides a structured approach for leaders transitioning into new roles to accelerate their learning, build credibility, and secure early wins. It helps navigate the critical transition period by providing a systematic process for understanding the organization, building relationships, and establishing momentum.

## When to Use

- Starting a new role (especially external hires or promotions)
- Taking on a new team or area of responsibility
- Entering a new company or organization
- Leading through organizational change or restructuring
- When you need to quickly establish credibility and demonstrate value

## Key Components/Steps

### 1. Prepare Yourself (Before Joining)
- **Assess transition risk**: Evaluate how many transitions you're experiencing (new industry, company, function, geography, etc.)
- **Four pillars of preparation**:
  - **Business orientation**: Research company, products, strategies, financials
  - **Stakeholder connection**: Identify and connect with key people early
  - **Expectations alignment**: Understand performance management and working style
  - **Cultural adaptation**: Learn organizational norms and identify culture interpreters

### 2. Accelerate Learning (When You Join)
- **Iterative learning plan**: Research → Listening tour → Update questions/hypotheses → Repeat
- **Learn the business**: Market, product, technologies
- **Learn the organization**: Systems, structures, culture, politics
- **Initial listening tour questions**:
  1. What are the biggest challenges facing the organization?
  2. Why is the organization facing these challenges?
  3. What are the most promising untapped opportunities?
  4. What would need to happen to tap those opportunities?
  5. If you were me, what would you focus attention on?

### 3. Match Strategy to Situation (STARS Model)
Diagnose which situation you're entering:
- **Start-up**: Building from scratch, limited resources
- **Turnaround**: Saving a business in trouble, making tough cuts
- **Accelerated Growth**: Managing rapid expansion, scaling systems
- **Realignment**: Reenergizing a previously successful org facing challenges
- **Sustaining Success**: Preserving vitality and taking to next level

### 4. Negotiate Success (5 Key Conversations)
- **Situational diagnosis**: Understand how your boss sees your STARS portfolio
- **Expectations conversation**: Align on what success looks like and when
- **Resource conversation**: Negotiate for critical resources and support
- **Style conversation**: Align on communication, RACI, and collaboration preferences
- **Personal development conversation**: Get feedback and align on growth areas

### 5. Secure Early Wins
- **Build personal credibility**: Establish yourself as demanding but satisfied, accessible but authoritative, decisive but judicious
- **Launch early-win projects**: Identify 3-4 projects achievable in first 90 days
- **Evaluate early wins** on: Impact, Cost, Strategic Alignment, Organizational Change
- **Make waves of change**: Plan 3 distinct waves over first 18 months (Immersion → Reshaping → Consolidation)

### 6. Achieve Alignment
Ensure alignment across four systems:
- **Strategic direction**: Mission, vision, strategy
- **Org structure**: Units, reporting relationships, decision rights
- **Processes**: Systems for adding value
- **Skills**: Individual expertise, relational knowledge, embedded knowledge

### 7. Build Your Team
- **Assess team**: Evaluate competence, judgment, energy, focus, relationships, trust
- **Evolve team**: Plan for each individual (replace, move, keep, develop, observe)
- **Align team**: Define goals, align incentives, articulate vision
- **Lead team**: Assess and improve processes, lead decision-making

### 8. Create Alliances
- **Draw influence map**: Identify key players, supporters, opponents, persuadables
- **Influence pivotal players**: Analyze stance, consult actively, frame appropriately, use social influence

### 9. Manage Yourself
- **Reflect regularly**: How do you feel? What's bothering you? What's gone well/poorly?
- **Invest in three pillars**: 90-day strategy, personal disciplines, support system
- **Build support system**: Work infrastructure, home/family, advice & counsel network

### 10. Accelerate Everyone
Recognize that your transition affects everyone else and help them navigate the change.

## Key Principles

- **Take 100% responsibility** for making relationships work
- **Underpromise and overdeliver** to build credibility
- **Focus on early wins** in areas important to your boss
- **Adapt to your boss's style** rather than expecting them to change
- **Don't surprise your boss** - give heads up on problems and plans
- **Match your approach to the STARS situation** you're entering
- **Build credibility before making big changes** - early wins create momentum

## Common Pitfalls

- **Sticking with what you know** instead of learning what works in the new context
- **Falling prey to the "action imperative"** and acting impulsively
- **Setting unrealistic expectations** by having unclear mandate
- **Attempting to do too much** and lacking focus
- **Coming in with "the" answer** and alienating others
- **Engaging in the wrong type of learning** (too much business, not enough culture/politics)
- **Neglecting horizontal relationships** and focusing too much on senior leadership
- **Undefended boundaries** leading to taking on too much
- **Brittleness/stubbornness** in failed courses of action
- **Isolation** from people on the ground
