# Program Management

## Purpose

Program management frameworks help coordinate work across teams and ensure visibility, alignment, and accountability. They provide structure for managing complex, cross-functional initiatives.

## When to Use

- When managing cross-functional programs
- To ensure visibility across teams
- When you need regular progress tracking
- To coordinate multiple initiatives
- When you need stakeholder alignment

## Key Components/Steps

### Monthly Business Review

**Purpose**: Regular review of business performance and progress

**Key Elements**:
- Business metrics and performance
- Progress on key initiatives
- Risks and blockers
- Next month priorities
- Resource needs

**Frequency**: Monthly

**Attendees**: Leadership, key stakeholders

### Stakeholder Updates

**Purpose**: Keep stakeholders informed and aligned

**Key Elements**:
- Progress updates
- Learnings and insights
- Next steps
- Questions for feedback

**Frequency**: Bi-weekly or monthly

**Format**: Written updates, meetings, or both

### Decision Log

**Purpose**: Document important decisions for future reference

**Key Elements**:
- Decision made
- Rationale
- Who made it (DACI)
- Date
- Impact

**Use**: Reference point when questions come up later

## Key Principles

- **Regular cadence**: Establish consistent update rhythms
- **Visibility**: Make progress visible to all stakeholders
- **Accountability**: Clear owners for each initiative
- **Documentation**: Document decisions and progress
- **Alignment**: Ensure everyone understands priorities

## Common Pitfalls

- Inconsistent cadence (updates irregular)
- Not documenting decisions (forget why decisions were made)
- Too many updates (overwhelming)
- Not enough visibility (stakeholders in dark)
- No clear accountability (who owns what?)

## Related Frameworks

- **DACI/RACI**: Clarify roles and accountability
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Program management includes communication
- **Roadmaps**: Programs often have roadmaps
- **Strategy**: Programs execute strategy

## Example Use Cases

- **Cross-functional Initiative**: Use Monthly Business Review to track progress
- **Major Product Launch**: Regular stakeholder updates to keep everyone aligned
- **Strategic Initiative**: Decision log to document strategic decisions
