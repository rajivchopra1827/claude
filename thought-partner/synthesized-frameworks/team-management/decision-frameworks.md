# Decision Frameworks (DACI & RACI)

## Purpose

DACI and RACI frameworks clarify roles and responsibilities for decisions and work. They ensure the right people are involved at the right level, prevent confusion about who decides what, and create accountability.

## When to Use

- When making important decisions
- To clarify who is responsible for what
- When you need to avoid decision bottlenecks
- To ensure accountability
- When coordinating cross-functional work

## Key Components/Steps

### DACI (Driver, Approver, Contributor, Informed)

**Roles**:
- **Driver**: Owns the decision, drives it forward, does the work
- **Approver**: Makes the final decision, has veto power
- **Contributor**: Provides input and expertise
- **Informed**: Needs to know about the decision but doesn't need to contribute

**Use**: For decisions that need to be made

### RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)

**Roles**:
- **Responsible**: Does the work
- **Accountable**: Owns the outcome, has final accountability
- **Consulted**: Provides input (two-way communication)
- **Informed**: Needs to know (one-way communication)

**Use**: For work and processes (broader than just decisions)

### Key Differences

- **DACI**: Focused on decisions
- **RACI**: Focused on work/responsibilities
- **Accountable vs Approver**: Accountable owns outcome, Approver makes decision
- **Consulted vs Contributor**: Similar but RACI emphasizes two-way communication

## Key Principles

- **One Driver/Responsible**: Only one person should drive/be responsible
- **One Approver/Accountable**: Only one person should approve/be accountable
- **Clear roles**: Everyone should know their role
- **Right people, right level**: Don't over-involve or under-involve
- **Document it**: Make RACI/DACI visible

## Common Pitfalls

- Multiple Drivers/Responsible (confusion)
- Multiple Approvers/Accountable (bottlenecks)
- Too many Contributors/Consulted (slows down)
- Not documenting roles
- Not updating as things change
- Confusing DACI and RACI

## Related Frameworks

- **Decision Log**: Document decisions made using DACI
- **Team Management**: RACI helps clarify team responsibilities
- **Program Management**: Use RACI for cross-functional programs
- **Strategy Creation**: Use RACI to clarify strategy team roles

## Example Use Cases

- **Product Decision**: Driver = PM, Approver = VP Product, Contributors = Engineering/Design leads, Informed = Sales/Marketing
- **Cross-functional Work**: Responsible = PM, Accountable = VP Product, Consulted = Engineering/Design, Informed = Other stakeholders
- **Strategy Creation**: Use RACI to clarify who owns strategy, who contributes, who needs to know
