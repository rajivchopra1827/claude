# Product Principles

## Purpose

Product principles are foundational beliefs and values that guide how product teams make decisions, prioritize work, and operate. They serve as a north star when process doesn't provide clear guidance, helping teams maintain consistency and make better decisions in ambiguous situations.

## When to Use

- Establishing product culture and operating norms
- Making decisions when process doesn't provide clear guidance
- Onboarding new team members
- Resolving conflicts or disagreements about approach
- Evaluating whether work aligns with organizational values
- Guiding strategic and tactical decisions
- Creating consistency across teams

## Key Components/Steps

### Strategy Principles

**Start with customer needs**
- Always begin with who you're serving and what they need most
- Don't let existing business constraints or solution ideas predefine focus

**Outcomes > Outputs**
- Drive outcomes for the business (make profit)
- Not here to just ship features
- Identify and move the right proxy metrics to drive outcomes

**Innovate where it matters, nowhere else**
- Clear about where you want to win/differentiate
- Focus innovation there
- Don't need to be best everywhere else

**Focus until it's uncomfortable**
- Strategy is as much about what you say no to as what you say yes to
- If not uncomfortable with how much you're saying no, haven't said it enough

**Take an educated bet...but take a bet**
- Strategy is an educated bet, not a guarantee
- Insights direct it, but intuition (creativity + courage) fills the gap
- Not driven by fear of failure - worst bet is no bet at all

### Operating Principles

**Principles > Process**
- Principles drive behaviors we rely on every day (fill the white space)
- Process attempts to systematize but can never replace principles
- Strong principles can operate with very little process

**Shared Ownership**
- Everyone owns what we build & why
- "I'll figure it out" is everyone's default state
- Don't wait to be told what to do - provide solutions to problems

**Think big → start small → learn quickly**
- Dream in v10, start with v1
- Hypothesis-driven and test quickly to iterate
- Don't build straight to v10, don't start v1 without idea of where it's going

**Share early & often - think "shitty first draft"**
- Editing is easier than writing
- Feedback accelerates good ideas and transforms bad ones
- Over-thinking wrong idea can waste time and convince you to invest

### Team Principles

**Stay as small as possible**
- Small teams of high performers do more & better work
- Large teams often dilute focus and invent overhead work

**Always raise the bar**
- Great people make everything and everyone work better
- Underperforming or mediocre folks create negative loops

**Empowerment = Direction + Autonomy in correct balance**
- Teams given just enough direction + autonomy to stretch and bridge gap
- Not enough direction or autonomy is failure of leadership

**Safety is an innovative advantage**
- Innovation requires creativity, which requires safety to take risk and be wrong
- Teams without safety will work hard and achieve very little

### Additional Product Principles (Shreyas Doshi)

**Customer focus**
- Before getting excited about low-hanging fruit, be sure you're under the right tree
- The "product" isn't just buttons & pixels - treat everything that touches user as product
- Direction of movement more important than speed
- Be opinionated about target customer segment(s)
- Create something that resonates highly for small segment vs trying to appeal to everyone

**User research**
- Chief purpose is to understand users' motivations
- Tactics & details useful, but not full value until you understand motivations
- Understanding motivations skyrockets team creativity

**Creative execution**
- When product problem is difficult or high stakes, creative execution is key
- Don't accept first solution that comes to mind - often just "conventional & safe"
- Look hard & break things down to essence - there's always another way
- Don't underestimate value of delightful surprises

**Strategy evaluation**
- Is it serving user need very well?
- Is it differentiated enough?
- Is the market large enough (or will it be) to meet business goals?

**Strategy creation**
- Requires creativity at least as much as analytical chops
- Need team of ≤3 people: market expert, creative product expert, tech expert
- Don't do strategy-by-committee
- Understand Porter's 5 Forces, Porter's 3 Generic Strategies, Helmer's 7 Powers
- Deeply understand domain in which product operates

**Product work fundamentals**
- Part science, part art - don't believe it's all one or the other
- Pay attention to both aspects, use product context as guide
- Fundamentally about cohesion between: worthy vision, shrewd strategy, wise execution
- Goal: address user needs and make sufficient business impact
- The rest is noise

## Key Principles

- **Customer-first**: Always start with customer needs
- **Outcomes over outputs**: Focus on business results, not features shipped
- **Focus**: Say no until uncomfortable
- **Principles over process**: Principles guide behavior when process doesn't
- **Shared ownership**: Everyone owns what we build and why
- **Think big, start small**: Dream big but start small and learn quickly
- **Share early**: Get feedback on "shitty first drafts"
- **Small teams**: High performers in small teams do better work
- **Raise the bar**: Great people make everything better
- **Empowerment balance**: Right mix of direction and autonomy
- **Safety enables innovation**: Need safety to take risks and be wrong

## Common Pitfalls

- **Focusing on outputs instead of outcomes**: Shipping features without measuring impact
- **Saying yes to everything**: Not saying no enough, lack of focus
- **Process over principles**: Creating rigid processes without underlying principles
- **Waiting for direction**: Not taking ownership, waiting to be told what to do
- **Building to v10 immediately**: Not starting small and learning
- **Perfectionism**: Over-thinking instead of sharing early drafts
- **Large teams**: Diluting focus with too many people
- **Not raising the bar**: Keeping underperformers, not improving team
- **Wrong empowerment balance**: Too much or too little direction/autonomy
- **Lack of safety**: Teams afraid to take risks, killing innovation
- **Strategy-by-committee**: Too many people involved in strategy creation
- **Ignoring domain knowledge**: Not deeply understanding the domain

## Related Frameworks

- **Product Operating Model**: How principles translate into operating model
- **Product Strategy**: How principles guide strategy creation
- **Product Discovery**: How principles guide discovery work
- **Team Maturity Assessment**: Assessing how well teams embody principles
- **PM Competency Models**: Skills needed to live principles

## Example Use Cases

- **Making prioritization decision**: Use "outcomes > outputs" and "focus until uncomfortable" to say no to good ideas
- **Onboarding new PM**: Share product principles to help them understand how team operates
- **Resolving conflict**: Use "principles > process" to guide decision when process doesn't apply
- **Evaluating work**: Use principles to assess if work aligns with organizational values
- **Creating strategy**: Use "think big → start small" and "take educated bet" principles
- **Building team**: Use "stay small" and "raise the bar" principles for hiring
