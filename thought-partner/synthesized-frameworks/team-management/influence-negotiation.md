# Influence & Principled Negotiation

## Purpose

Influence and principled negotiation frameworks help product managers navigate situations where they need to persuade others, resolve conflicts, and make decisions without direct authority. These frameworks provide approaches for building alliances, negotiating resources, and driving alignment across stakeholders.

## When to Use

- Negotiating resources, timelines, or priorities with stakeholders
- Resolving conflicts between teams or individuals
- Building support for product decisions or strategy changes
- Influencing executives or key decision-makers
- Creating alliances to support initiatives
- Managing up and across the organization
- Handling situations where you lack direct authority

## Key Components/Steps

### Principled Negotiation (Getting to Yes)

**Four key principles:**

1. **Separate people from the problem**
   - Focus on interests, not positions
   - Address emotions and relationship issues separately
   - Build working relationships

2. **Focus on interests, not positions**
   - Understand underlying needs and motivations
   - Look for shared interests
   - Explore multiple options

3. **Invent options for mutual gain**
   - Brainstorm creative solutions
   - Look for win-win opportunities
   - Separate inventing from deciding

4. **Insist on objective criteria**
   - Use fair standards and procedures
   - Base decisions on principles, not pressure
   - Apply consistent standards

### Influence Strategies

**Three approaches to influence:**

1. **Logos (Logic/Data)**
   - Focus on data, logic, and addressing cognitive biases
   - Use evidence and analysis
   - Address rational concerns

2. **Ethos (Principles/Authority)**
   - Focus on principles, policies, and values
   - Reference organizational standards
   - Seek exceptions when appropriate

3. **Pathos (Emotion/Meaning)**
   - Focus on creating meaning and overcoming triggers
   - Help people step back and see bigger picture
   - Address emotional concerns

### Building Alliances

**Influence mapping process:**

1. **Identify key players**
   - Who are the influential players?
   - What do you need from them?
   - When do you need it?

2. **Categorize players**
   - **Supporters**: Share vision, actively or quietly working for change
   - **Opponents**: Will oppose due to beliefs, comfort with status quo, fear, or threat to power
   - **Persuadables**: Indifferent, undecided, or waiting to see where wind blows

3. **Influence pivotal players**
   - **Analyze their stance**: Understand motivations, driving/restraining forces, alternatives
   - **Consultation**: Active listening, make them feel heard, allow small influence on direction
   - **Framing**: Communicate according to what matters to them (logos/ethos/pathos)
   - **Social influence**: Leverage consistency, commitments, obligations, reputation
   - **Plan roll-out**: Sequence conversations with action-forcing event

### Managing Up

**Key principles:**

- **Take 100% responsibility** for making the relationship work
- **Don't surprise your boss** - give heads up on problems
- **Don't approach with only problems** - bring solutions or plans
- **Clarify expectations early and often**
- **Aim for early wins** in areas important to your boss
- **Adapt to your boss's style** rather than expecting them to change

## Key Principles

- **Focus on interests, not positions** - understand underlying motivations
- **Separate people from problems** - maintain relationships while solving issues
- **Create value before claiming it** - expand the pie before dividing it
- **Use objective criteria** - base decisions on fair standards
- **Build relationships** - influence is built on trust and credibility
- **Frame messages appropriately** - adapt communication to audience (logic/principles/emotion)
- **Sequence conversations strategically** - build momentum toward action-forcing events
- **Leverage social influence** - understand consistency, commitments, reputation

## Common Pitfalls

- **Focusing on positions instead of interests** - getting stuck on what people say they want
- **Mixing people with problems** - letting relationship issues cloud problem-solving
- **Coming in with "the" answer** - not listening or allowing others to influence direction
- **Using pressure instead of principles** - forcing decisions rather than using objective criteria
- **Neglecting relationship building** - focusing only on the immediate issue
- **Framing messages incorrectly** - using logic when emotion is needed, or vice versa
- **Trying to influence everyone equally** - not prioritizing pivotal players
- **Moving too fast** - not building support before making decisions
- **Being too rigid** - not adapting approach based on situation and person

## Related Frameworks

- **DACI/RACI**: Decision-making frameworks that clarify who needs to be influenced
- **Stakeholder Management**: Systematic approach to identifying and engaging stakeholders
- **Product Operating Model**: Understanding how decisions are made in product organizations

## Example Use Cases

- **Negotiating roadmap priorities**: Use principled negotiation to understand stakeholder interests, invent options for mutual gain, use data as objective criteria
- **Building support for strategy change**: Create influence map, identify supporters/opponents/persuadables, frame message appropriately for each group, sequence conversations
- **Resolving conflict between engineering and design**: Separate people from problem, focus on shared interests (user value), invent options, use user research as objective criteria
- **Getting executive buy-in**: Use logos (data), ethos (principles), pathos (vision), build alliance with their trusted advisors, create action-forcing event
