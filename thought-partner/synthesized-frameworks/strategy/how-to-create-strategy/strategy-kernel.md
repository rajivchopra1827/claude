# Strategy Kernel (Rumelt)

## Purpose

The Strategy Kernel provides the essential three-part structure of good strategy: Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, and Coherent Action. It ensures strategy addresses the "why," "what," and "how" questions that make strategy effective.

## When to Use

- When creating a new strategy
- To structure strategy thinking and documentation
- To evaluate if a strategy is complete
- When you need to explain strategy to others
- As a framework for strategy workshops

## Key Components/Steps

### 1. Diagnosis (Why)

**Purpose**: Analyze the situation and identify key problems

- Understand the current situation (users, business, market)
- Identify the core problems or challenges
- Analyze what's changing and why
- Recognize critical factors in the situation

**Key Questions**:
- What are the core problems we need to solve?
- What's changing in our users/business/market?
- What are the critical factors in this situation?

### 2. Guiding Policy (What)

**Purpose**: Outline approach to solve problems and create advantage

- Define the overall approach or direction
- Set policies that guide decisions
- Create advantage or leverage strengths
- Address obstacles identified in diagnosis

**Key Questions**:
- What's our overall approach to solving these problems?
- What policies will guide our decisions?
- How will we create advantage?

### 3. Coherent Action (How)

**Purpose**: Specific actionable steps to execute the guiding policy

- Define concrete actions to take
- Ensure actions are coordinated and reinforce each other
- Make actions specific and achievable
- Create a plan that executes the guiding policy

**Key Questions**:
- What specific actions will we take?
- How do these actions work together?
- Are these actions achievable?

## Key Principles

- **All three parts are essential**: Strategy needs diagnosis, policy, AND action
- **Diagnosis comes first**: Can't create good policy without understanding problems
- **Policy guides action**: Actions should flow from the guiding policy
- **Actions must be coherent**: All actions should reinforce each other (1+1=3)
- **Simple structure**: The kernel is the minimal structure for good strategy

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping diagnosis and jumping to solutions
- Having policy without actionable steps
- Having actions that don't align with policy
- Creating actions that conflict with each other
- Not updating diagnosis as situation changes

## Related Frameworks

- **Good Strategy vs Bad Strategy**: Kernel is the structure of good strategy
- **Strategy Creation Processes**: Use kernel as structure within larger processes
- **Michael Porter's Strategy**: Kernel aligns with competitive strategy thinking
- **Your Strategy Process**: Kernel fits into diagnosis and vision/strategy phases

## Example Use Cases

- **Product Strategy**: Diagnosis = "Users struggle with onboarding complexity". Policy = "Simplify onboarding through progressive disclosure". Action = "Build wizard flow, add tooltips, create video tutorials".
- **Competitive Strategy**: Diagnosis = "Competitors copying our features". Policy = "Focus on network effects competitors can't replicate". Action = "Build social features, create data moats, invest in community".
