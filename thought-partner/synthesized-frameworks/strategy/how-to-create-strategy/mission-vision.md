# Mission & Vision

## Purpose

Mission and Vision provide the foundational "why" and "what" for strategy. Mission defines your core purpose, while Vision describes the future state you're working toward. Together, they anchor and inspire strategic work.

## When to Use

- At the start of strategy creation
- When you need to align teams around purpose and direction
- To communicate strategy to stakeholders
- When creating or revising company/product direction
- To inspire and guide decision-making

## Key Components/Steps

### Mission

**Definition**: "Why do we exist, for whom?" (our core purpose)

**Characteristics**:
- One simple, short, memorable sentence
- Answers: "we exist to do what, for whom?"
- States the purpose of the company/product
- Enduring (doesn't change frequently)

**Examples**:
- Grailed: "To make buying and selling high-quality menswear simple, safe, and accessible"
- TaskRabbit: "To make everyday life easier for everyday people"
- Pinterest: "To bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love"

### Vision

**Definition**: "A vivid description of how the future will look different for your users as a result of your products and/or services."

**Characteristics**:
- **Aligns** by being tangible and opinionated:
  - Tells a story about a real person with a real problem
  - Expresses clear point of view on what you're building
  - Makes clear how you're differentiated
- **Inspires** by being a memorable story:
  - Can be told/consumed in ~5 minutes
  - Ideally visual in nature

**Vision Ingredients**:
- User persona and their problem
- Current state (how things work today)
- Future state (how things will work)
- Your product's role in the transformation
- Differentiation (why you, not competitors)

## Key Principles

- **Mission is enduring**: Changes rarely, if ever
- **Vision is aspirational**: Describes future state, not current
- **Mission answers why**: Purpose and reason for existing
- **Vision answers what**: Where you're going
- **Strategy answers how**: How you'll get there
- **Both should be memorable**: Easy to remember and repeat

## Common Pitfalls

- Making mission too generic ("be the best")
- Vision that's not specific enough
- Confusing mission with vision
- Creating mission/vision that doesn't guide decisions
- Not making them memorable or inspiring
- Mission/vision that everyone forgets

## Related Frameworks

- **Strategy Creation Processes**: Mission/Vision are foundational to strategy
- **Strategy Kernel**: Mission/Vision inform the Diagnosis and Guiding Policy
- **Good Strategy**: Mission/Vision help ensure strategy is coherent and inspiring
- **Differentiation**: Vision should make differentiation clear

## Example Use Cases

- **Company Foundation**: Create mission and vision when starting a company
- **Product Strategy**: Define mission/vision before creating product strategy
- **Team Alignment**: Use mission/vision to align teams around shared purpose
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Share mission/vision to communicate direction
