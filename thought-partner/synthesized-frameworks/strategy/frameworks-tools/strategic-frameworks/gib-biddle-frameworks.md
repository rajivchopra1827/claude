# Gib Biddle's Strategic Frameworks

## Purpose

Gib Biddle's frameworks (DHM, GEM, GLEe) provide structured ways to evaluate and create product strategy. They help ensure strategy creates customer delight, is hard to copy, generates margin, and drives growth.

## When to Use

- When evaluating product strategy
- To guide product decisions
- When creating new products or features
- To ensure strategy is sustainable
- When planning product evolution

## Key Components/Steps

### DHM Model (Delight / Hard to Copy / Margin)

**Purpose**: Evaluate if a product feature/strategy creates sustainable competitive advantage

**Three Dimensions**:
1. **Delight**: Does it create customer delight?
2. **Hard to Copy**: Is it difficult for competitors to replicate?
3. **Margin**: Does it generate profitability?

**Key Principle**: Features/strategies should score high on all three dimensions for sustainable advantage

**Use**: Evaluate product ideas, features, or strategic bets against DHM criteria

### GEM Model (Growth / Engagement / Monetization)

**Purpose**: Framework for product strategy focusing on three key outcomes

**Three Dimensions**:
1. **Growth**: How will this drive user acquisition?
2. **Engagement**: How will this increase user engagement?
3. **Monetization**: How will this generate revenue?

**Key Principle**: Products need to balance all three - can't optimize for one at expense of others

**Use**: Structure product strategy around growth, engagement, and monetization goals

### GLEe Model (Get Big / Lead / Expand)

**Purpose**: Framework for product evolution and market expansion

**Three Stages**:
1. **Get Big**: Establish product in initial market/segment
2. **Lead**: Become leader in that market/segment
3. **Expand**: Expand to new markets/segments from position of strength

**Key Principle**: Don't expand until you've gotten big and led in your initial market

**Use**: Plan product evolution and market expansion strategy

## Key Principles

- **Sustainable advantage**: Strategy should be hard to copy (DHM)
- **Customer value**: Must create delight, not just functionality (DHM)
- **Business value**: Must generate margin/profitability (DHM)
- **Balance outcomes**: Growth, engagement, and monetization all matter (GEM)
- **Sequential expansion**: Get big, then lead, then expand (GLEe)
- **Don't skip stages**: Can't expand before leading (GLEe)

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating features that are easy to copy (DHM)
- Optimizing for one GEM dimension at expense of others
- Expanding before establishing leadership (GLEe)
- Features that don't create delight (DHM)
- Features that don't generate margin (DHM)

## Related Frameworks

- **7 Powers**: DHM "Hard to Copy" relates to powers
- **Strategy Creation**: Use frameworks to evaluate strategic options
- **Differentiation**: DHM helps identify differentiation opportunities
- **3x Framework**: GLEe relates to Explore/Expand/Extract stages

## Example Use Cases

- **Feature Evaluation**: Use DHM to evaluate if a feature creates sustainable advantage
- **Product Strategy**: Use GEM to structure product strategy around key outcomes
- **Market Expansion**: Use GLEe to plan when and how to expand to new markets
- **Strategic Planning**: Use all three frameworks to guide strategic decisions
