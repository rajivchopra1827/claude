# Three Horizons Framework (McKinsey)

## Purpose

The Three Horizons Framework helps organizations balance focus between current business needs (Horizon 1), future growth opportunities (Horizon 3), and the bridge between them (Horizon 2). It ensures companies don't only focus on today while missing tomorrow's opportunities.

## When to Use

- When planning long-term strategy
- To balance current operations with future innovation
- When you need to allocate resources across time horizons
- To ensure innovation doesn't get ignored
- When planning growth and transformation

## Key Components/Steps

### The Three Horizons

**Horizon 1: Maintain & Defend Core Business**
- **Focus**: Leverage existing products and services
- **Timeframe**: Current business (0-12 months)
- **Goal**: Improve margins, optimize processes, increase short-term profits
- **Examples**: Product upgrades, new features, subscription models, customer service improvements
- **Allocation**: ~70% of effort

**Horizon 2: Nurture Emerging Business**
- **Focus**: Extend existing business into new revenue areas
- **Timeframe**: 1-3 years
- **Goal**: Create new innovations in existing market or explore new markets
- **Examples**: New product lines, geographic expansion, business model extensions
- **Characteristics**: Extension of existing business model, should return reliably
- **Allocation**: ~20% of effort

**Horizon 3: Create Genuinely New Business**
- **Focus**: Create growth opportunities and explore new markets
- **Timeframe**: 3-10+ years
- **Goal**: Discretionary investments in transformative opportunities
- **Examples**: New products, R&D (AI/automation), new technologies, pilot programs, M&A
- **Characteristics**: Unprecedented strategic implications, high uncertainty
- **Allocation**: ~10% of effort

### Application Process

1. **Start with Horizon 1**: Identify biggest assets and reasons for current success
2. **Imagine losing Horizon 1**: What would you do if current advantages disappeared?
3. **Define Horizon 3**: That's what you would do (but still need capabilities to win)
4. **Build Horizon 2**: Create bridge from Horizon 1 to Horizon 3
   - Work backward from Horizon 3
   - Work forward from Horizon 1
   - Should contain enough core assets to be profitable

### 70/20/10 Rule

- **70% Horizon 1**: Survive and thrive today
- **20% Horizon 2**: Bridge to future (contains failures, need enough irons in fire)
- **10% Horizon 3**: Long-term vision (research, experimentation, light launches)

## Key Principles

- **Balance all horizons**: Don't focus only on today or only on tomorrow
- **Horizon 2 is the bridge**: Connects current business to future
- **Horizon 3 needs capabilities**: Still need strengths to win, just different ones
- **Allocation matters**: 70/20/10 rule ensures proper balance
- **Horizons evolve**: Horizon 2 becomes Horizon 1 over time

## Common Pitfalls

- Only focusing on Horizon 1 (ignoring future)
- Only focusing on Horizon 3 (ignoring current business)
- Not building Horizon 2 bridge
- Wrong allocation (too much in one horizon)
- Treating horizons as separate (they should connect)

## Related Frameworks

- **Strategy Creation**: Use horizons to structure long-term strategy
- **3x Framework**: Horizons relate to Explore/Expand/Extract stages
- **Roadmaps**: Horizons inform roadmap structure (Now/Next/Later)
- **Innovation Management**: Horizons help manage innovation portfolio

## Example Use Cases

- **Strategic Planning**: Structure strategy across three time horizons
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate 70/20/10 across horizons
- **Innovation Management**: Ensure innovation (H3) doesn't get ignored
- **Growth Planning**: Plan how to grow from current (H1) to future (H3) via H2
