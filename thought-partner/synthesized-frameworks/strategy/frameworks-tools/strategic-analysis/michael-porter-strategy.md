# Michael Porter's Strategy

## Purpose

Michael Porter's strategy framework focuses on achieving superior performance through differentiation or cost leadership. It emphasizes that strategy is about being unique, not being the best, and that competitive advantage comes from a different configuration of activities than competitors.

## When to Use

- When creating competitive strategy
- To understand industry structure and profitability
- To identify sources of competitive advantage
- When evaluating strategic positioning
- To understand why some companies outperform others

## Key Components/Steps

### Core Definition

**Strategy**: "Explains how an organization, faced with competition, will achieve superior performance."

**Success Measure**: ROIC (Return on Invested Capital), not market share

### Five Forces Framework

Five forces determine industry profitability:

1. **Buyer Power**: Buyers' ability to negotiate lower prices
   - Increases when: Undifferentiated products, expensive relative to income, inconsequential to performance
   - Effect: Prices decrease

2. **Supplier Power**: Suppliers' ability to charge higher prices
   - Increases when: Industry needs them more than they need industry, high fixed costs, can threaten vertical integration
   - Effect: Costs increase

3. **Threat of Substitutes**: Products/services meeting same need differently
   - Effect: Prices decrease, costs increase

4. **Barriers to Entry**: Difficulty for new competitors to enter
   - Includes: Economies of scale, switching costs, network effects, capital investments, distribution access, regulations

5. **Rivalry**: Intensity of competition among existing players
   - Effect: Prices decrease, costs increase

### Competitive Advantage

**Two Sources**:
1. **Differentiation**: Ability to charge higher relative price
   - Relative Price = Unique + Valuable to Customer
2. **Cost Leadership**: More efficient ways to create/produce/deliver
   - Relative Cost = More efficient use of capital

**Value Chain**: Sequence of activities to design, produce, sell, deliver, and support products
- Competitive advantage comes from differences in activities
- Can perform same activities better OR choose different activities

### Strategic Fit

Three types of fit:
1. **Consistency**: Each activity is aligned
2. **Complement**: Activities reinforce each other
3. **Substitution**: Choice substitutes need for something else

**Fit means**: The whole matters more than any individual part

### Trade-offs

**Core Principle**: Strategy is about trade-offs - choices that make strategies sustainable because they're not easy to match

- Strategy explains how to achieve superior performance in competitive environment
- Strategic competition = choosing path different from others
- Trade-offs lie at heart of strategy
- Clarity about what you won't do is best way to succeed at what you choose

### Five Signs of Good Strategy

1. Unique value proposition
2. Tailored value chain
3. Trade-offs different from rivals
4. Fit in value chain
5. Continuity over time

## Key Principles

- **Be unique, not best**: Competition to be best leads to mediocre performance
- **Focus on profits, not market share**: ROIC matters more than size
- **Different configuration**: Advantage comes from different activities, not just better execution
- **Trade-offs are essential**: Strategy requires saying no
- **Fit creates advantage**: Activities must reinforce each other
- **Continuity matters**: Strategy should be stable over time

## Common Pitfalls

- Competing to be "the best" (zero-sum competition)
- Focusing on market share instead of profitability
- Trying to be everything to everyone (no trade-offs)
- Performing same activities as competitors (no differentiation)
- Activities that don't fit together (no coherence)
- Changing strategy too frequently (no continuity)

## Related Frameworks

- **Good Strategy vs Bad Strategy**: Porter's principles align with Rumelt's good strategy
- **7 Powers**: Sources of sustainable competitive advantage
- **Segmentation/Differentiation**: Porter's differentiation strategy
- **Four Fits**: Market-Product-Channel-Model fit relates to value chain

## Example Use Cases

- **Competitive Analysis**: Use Five Forces to understand industry profitability
- **Strategy Creation**: Use differentiation vs cost leadership to guide strategy
- **Value Chain Analysis**: Map activities to identify competitive advantages
- **Positioning**: Use Porter's framework to choose unique position
