# Four Fits Framework (Brian Balfour)

## Purpose

The Four Fits framework explains why some companies grow easily ("Smooth Sailers") while others struggle ("Tugboats") despite good execution. It identifies four critical fits that must align for $100M+ growth: Market-Product, Product-Channel, Channel-Model, and Model-Market.

## When to Use

- When evaluating growth potential
- To diagnose why growth is hard
- When planning product and channel strategy
- To understand why some products grow easily
- When moving up or down market

## Key Components/Steps

### The Four Fits

1. **Market-Product Fit**
   - **Wrong way**: Start with product, then find market
   - **Right way**: Start with market (problem + audience), then build product
   - **Key**: Understand problem and audience BEFORE building solution
   - **Signals**: Qualitative (interviews), quantitative (metrics), intuitive (founder insight)

2. **Product-Channel Fit**
   - **Core principle**: Products are built to fit with channels. Channels do NOT mold to products.
   - **Key**: Design product with specific channels in mind
   - **Mistake**: "We'll focus on product-market fit, then test channels" (wrong - channels determine product design)
   - **Examples**: Viral products designed for sharing, SEO-optimized products for organic search

3. **Channel-Model Fit**
   - **Core principle**: Your channels are determined by your model and vice versa.
   - **Key**: ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) must align
   - **ARPU ↔ CAC Spectrum**: Plot $100M+ companies on this spectrum - they align perfectly
   - **High ARPU**: Can afford high CAC channels (sales, partnerships)
   - **Low ARPU**: Need low CAC channels (organic, viral, self-serve)

4. **Model-Market Fit**
   - **Core principle**: Your market (and # of customers) influences your model.
   - **Key Math**: ARPU × Total Customers In Market × % You Can Capture ≥ $100M
   - **Threshold**: If math doesn't work, you don't have a $100M company
   - **Solution**: Change market, model, or both

### Key Lessons

1. **Need all four fits**: Missing any one prevents $100M+ growth
2. **Fits form ecosystem**: Can't think about fits in isolation - they work together
3. **Fits change continuously**: Must constantly revisit as market/product evolve

### Why Companies Fail Moving Up/Down Market

Moving between market segments often fails because:
- Different segments require different products (Product-Channel fit breaks)
- Different segments require different channels (Channel-Model fit breaks)
- Different segments have different ARPU potential (Model-Market fit breaks)

## Key Principles

- **Start with market, not product**: Understand problem and audience first
- **Design product for channels**: Channels don't adapt to products
- **ARPU and CAC must align**: Model determines viable channels
- **Math must work**: Model-Market fit requires viable unit economics
- **All fits required**: Missing any fit prevents growth
- **Fits are interconnected**: Changes to one affect others

## Common Pitfalls

- Building product before understanding market
- Testing channels after building product (too late)
- Mismatched ARPU and CAC (high CAC for low ARPU)
- Model-Market math doesn't work (not a $100M company)
- Thinking about fits in isolation
- Not revisiting fits as things change

## Related Frameworks

- **Product-Market Fit**: Four Fits expands on PMF concept
- **Segmentation**: Market-Product fit starts with market segmentation
- **Strategy Creation**: Four Fits informs product and channel strategy
- **7 Powers**: Can inform Product-Channel and Channel-Model fit

## Example Use Cases

- **Growth Diagnosis**: Use Four Fits to understand why growth is hard
- **Product Planning**: Design product with channels in mind
- **Channel Selection**: Choose channels that fit your ARPU/CAC model
- **Market Expansion**: Evaluate if moving up/down market is viable
