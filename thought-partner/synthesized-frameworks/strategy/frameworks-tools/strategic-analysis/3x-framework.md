# 3x Framework (Explore → Expand → Extract)

## Purpose

The 3x Framework helps you understand what stage your product is at and apply the right strategies for that stage. Different stages require different approaches, and applying the wrong stage's practices can be counterproductive.

## When to Use

- To understand what stage your product is in
- To apply stage-appropriate strategies
- When evaluating strategic options
- To avoid applying wrong-stage practices
- When planning product evolution

## Key Components/Steps

### The Three Stages

1. **Explore**
   - **Focus**: Finding product-market fit
   - **Goal**: Validate that you're solving a real problem for real customers
   - **Key Activities**: Customer discovery, rapid iteration, experimentation
   - **Metrics**: Qualitative signals, early traction indicators
   - **Strategy**: Focus on learning, not scaling

2. **Expand**
   - **Focus**: Scaling product-market fit
   - **Goal**: Grow user base and expand to new segments
   - **Key Activities**: Growth optimization, channel expansion, feature expansion
   - **Metrics**: Growth rates, retention, expansion metrics
   - **Strategy**: Scale what works, expand systematically

3. **Extract**
   - **Focus**: Maximizing value from established product
   - **Goal**: Optimize monetization, efficiency, and market position
   - **Key Activities**: Monetization optimization, efficiency improvements, market dominance
   - **Metrics**: Profitability, market share, efficiency metrics
   - **Strategy**: Optimize and defend position

### Cardinal Sin

**"Extract-stage 'best practices' applied to explore-stage companies"**

- Don't apply mature company practices to early-stage products
- Each stage requires different approaches
- What works in Extract stage can kill Explore stage companies

### Stage-Appropriate Strategies

**Explore Stage**:
- Rapid experimentation
- Customer interviews
- MVP development
- Pivot quickly if needed
- Don't over-optimize

**Expand Stage**:
- Scale successful experiments
- Optimize growth channels
- Expand to new segments
- Build for scale
- Balance growth and efficiency

**Extract Stage**:
- Optimize monetization
- Defend market position
- Improve efficiency
- Maximize profitability
- Focus on moats

## Key Principles

- **Different stages, different strategies**: What works in one stage doesn't work in another
- **Know your stage**: Understand where you are before applying strategies
- **Don't skip stages**: Can't extract before you've explored and expanded
- **Stage-appropriate practices**: Apply practices that match your stage
- **Evolution is natural**: Products move through stages over time

## Common Pitfalls

- Applying extract-stage practices to explore-stage products
- Trying to scale before finding product-market fit
- Not recognizing what stage you're in
- Skipping stages (trying to extract before expanding)
- Using wrong-stage metrics or strategies

## Related Frameworks

- **Product-Market Fit**: Explore stage is about finding PMF
- **Four Fits**: Different fits matter more at different stages
- **Strategy Creation**: Strategy should reflect your stage
- **Segmentation**: Stage affects segmentation approach

## Example Use Cases

- **Early Startup**: Recognize you're in Explore stage, focus on learning not scaling
- **Growing Product**: Understand you're in Expand stage, focus on scaling what works
- **Mature Product**: Recognize Extract stage, focus on optimization and defense
- **Strategic Planning**: Align strategy with your product's stage
