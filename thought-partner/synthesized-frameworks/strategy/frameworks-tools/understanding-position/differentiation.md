# Differentiation

## Purpose

Differentiation defines how you'll win in the market by being unique. It identifies what makes your product different and valuable in ways competitors can't easily copy. Good differentiation is the foundation of competitive advantage.

## When to Use

- When creating product strategy
- To identify competitive advantages
- When you need to decide how to compete
- To guide product and feature decisions
- When evaluating strategic options

## Key Components/Steps

### Three Ways to Differentiate

1. **Segment Focus**: Solution-segment fit, dominate specific segments
2. **Overall Cost Leadership**: Very opinionated low-cost position
3. **Uniqueness of Offering/Features**: Feature set is extremely unique (leverages 7 Powers)

**Warning**: "Stuck in the middle" = not taking a clear position (default outcome in mid-large companies)

### Differentiation Components

Differentiation is determined by:
- **User Needs**: What needs are you serving?
- **Alternatives**: What are customers using instead?
- **Unique Assets**: What advantages do you have?
- **Industry Direction**: Where is the market heading?
- **Creative Choices**: What unique choices can you make?
- **Chosen Segments**: Who are you serving?

### BTD Framework (Below Table Stakes / Table Stakes / Differentiate)

**Process**:
1. Identify core themes/categories of value for the space
2. Create market map showing relative strength (1-3) of each competitor for target segments
3. Define with strategy team whether you should be B/T/D for each theme

**Choices**:
- **Below Table Stakes (B)**: Don't need to match competitors (choose mostly B's)
- **Table Stakes (T)**: Must match competitors (last resort, avoid if possible)
- **Differentiate (D)**: Be meaningfully better (choose a few D's)

**Key Insight**: "If you make the mistake of saying T instead of B, game over because it will take years to get as good, and it won't even differentiate"

### Ulwick Model

| | Job Done Better | Job Done Worse |
|---|---|---|
| **Charge MORE** | Win underserved customers (ex: Microsoft Office) | Win customers with limited options (ex: Comcast) |
| **Charge LESS** | Win all types of customers (AWS) | Win overserved customers and non-consumers (ex: Google Docs) |

### Identifying Differentiation

**Formal & Slower Method**: HBS JTBD Strategy Creation Process
- Use when: Not yet a domain expert OR company requires tons of proof

**Informal & Faster Method**: BTD Framework
- Use when: Deep domain expertise AND right 2-3 person strategy team AND want to move quickly

### Segmentation ↔ Differentiation Iteration

- Hone target segments → See if you can differentiate (often cannot) → Back to segmentation
- Do this with: Customer Research, Domain Knowledge, Creativity, Simulation
- Segmentation determines which Needs/JTBD you're ranking for BTD

## Key Principles

- **Differentiation requires trade-offs**: Can't be everything to everyone
- **Segmentation enables differentiation**: Focus on segments where you can differentiate
- **Avoid "stuck in the middle"**: Take a clear position
- **Leverage unique assets**: Build on what competitors can't copy
- **Be creative**: Differentiation involves invention, not just discovery
- **Iterate with segmentation**: Work back and forth between segments and differentiation

## Common Pitfalls

- Trying to differentiate on table stakes (takes years, doesn't differentiate)
- Being "stuck in the middle" (no clear position)
- Not leveraging unique assets
- Ignoring industry direction
- Not making creative choices
- Not iterating with segmentation

## Related Frameworks

- **Segmentation**: Segmentation and differentiation iterate together
- **7 Powers**: Sources of sustainable competitive advantage
- **Michael Porter's Strategy**: Focus on differentiation vs cost leadership
- **BTD Framework**: Tool for identifying differentiation opportunities
- **Strategy Creation**: Differentiation is a core component of strategy

## Example Use Cases

- **Product Strategy**: Define how you'll differentiate in the market
- **Competitive Analysis**: Identify where you can differentiate vs competitors
- **Feature Prioritization**: Prioritize features that enable differentiation
- **Positioning**: Use differentiation to inform positioning
