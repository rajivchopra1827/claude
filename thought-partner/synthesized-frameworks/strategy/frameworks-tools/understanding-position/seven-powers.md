# 7 Powers (Hamilton Helmer)

## Purpose

7 Powers identifies the seven sources of sustainable competitive advantage (or "moats") that make businesses hard to copy. Understanding these powers helps you identify what advantages you have or could build, and informs strategic decisions about where to invest.

## When to Use

- When identifying competitive advantages
- To evaluate strategic options
- When creating differentiation strategy
- To understand why competitors can't copy you
- When making investment decisions

## Key Components/Steps

### The 7 Powers

1. **Scale Economies**
   - **Definition**: Per unit costs decline as volume increases
   - **Benefit**: Reduced costs
   - **Barrier**: Prohibitive costs of share gains
   - **Examples**: Spreading fixed costs (Netflix content, software), bulk purchasing power, hub & spoke logistics

2. **Network Economies**
   - **Definition**: Value realized by customer increases as userbase increases
   - **Benefit**: Ability to charge higher prices or monetize more
   - **Barrier**: Hard to gain market share (users don't want to switch due to lower value)
   - **Examples**: Marketplaces, social networks, platforms

3. **Counter-Positioning**
   - **Definition**: New, superior business model that incumbents cannot mimic due to anticipated cannibalization
   - **Benefit**: Lower costs and/or higher prices
   - **Barrier**: Cannibalization of existing business
   - **Examples**: Lower cost alternatives (Costco), disruptive business models

4. **Switching Costs**
   - **Definition**: Customers expect greater loss than value gained from switching
   - **Benefit**: Ability to charge higher prices
   - **Barrier**: Competitor must compensate customer to switch
   - **Examples**: Enterprise software migration, built-up resources (Notion content, eBay reputation)

5. **Branding**
   - **Definition**: Higher perceived value for objectively identical offering due to historical information
   - **Benefit**: Ability to charge higher prices (perceived quality, reduced uncertainty)
   - **Barrier**: Significant time and uncertainty to build brand
   - **Examples**: Luxury brands, trusted companies

6. **Cornered Resource**
   - **Definition**: Preferential access to coveted resource that independently enhances value
   - **Benefit**: Higher prices, lower costs, or better products
   - **Barrier**: Property/patent law, regulatory capture, personal preference (talent retention)
   - **Examples**: Unique IP (patents, Google search data), regulatory capture, distribution (app store), best talent (Pixar team)

7. **Process Power**
   - **Definition**: Organization and activity set enables lower costs and/or superior products that can only be matched by extended commitment
   - **Benefit**: Improved product and/or lower costs
   - **Barrier**: Significant time and/or investment to create process
   - **Examples**: Manufacturing (Toyota), delivery/logistics (Amazon), design & production (Zara), data process (Netflix recommendations)

## Key Principles

- **Powers create moats**: They make it hard for competitors to copy you
- **Multiple powers compound**: Having multiple powers creates stronger advantage
- **Powers take time to build**: Most require significant investment or time
- **Identify what you have**: Understand which powers you currently leverage
- **Build strategically**: Invest in powers that align with your strategy

## Common Pitfalls

- Not identifying existing powers
- Trying to build all powers (focus on 1-2)
- Underestimating time to build powers
- Not leveraging powers you already have
- Confusing temporary advantages with powers

## Related Frameworks

- **Differentiation**: Powers enable differentiation
- **Michael Porter's Strategy**: Powers relate to competitive advantage
- **Strategy Creation**: Use powers to identify "superpowers" in strategy
- **Four Fits**: Powers can be part of product-market fit

## Example Use Cases

- **Strategy Creation**: Identify your "superpowers" (Aakash Gupta's Step 3)
- **Competitive Analysis**: Understand why competitors can't copy you
- **Investment Decisions**: Invest in building or leveraging powers
- **Product Decisions**: Build features that strengthen your powers
