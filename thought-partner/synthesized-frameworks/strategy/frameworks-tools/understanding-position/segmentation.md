# Segmentation

## Purpose

Segmentation helps you identify "who" makes sense for you to serve now. It's the foundation of strategy because most strategy problems are actually segmentation problems. Good segmentation enables differentiation, guides product decisions, and informs distribution strategy.

## When to Use

- When creating or revising product strategy
- To identify which customers to prioritize
- When you can't differentiate across all segments
- To guide product and GTM decisions
- When you need to make trade-offs about who to serve

## Key Components/Steps

### Segmentation Dimensions

Segmentation should be based on:

1. **Access**: Can we readily reach and sell to these customers?
2. **Business Goals**: Do these customers align with our business objectives?
3. **Underserved Needs**: Do these customers have needs that aren't well met?
4. **Overserved Needs**: Are we solving more than they need (opportunity to simplify)?
5. **Product Stage**: What stage of product-market fit are we at?
6. **Likelihood of Differentiation**: Can we differentiate for this segment?

### How to Segment

**Combine 2 of**: Who / What / Where / How / Why / When

**Dimensions to Consider** (best to worst):
- Needs-based (specific problems)
- Category of needs (higher-level problem categories)
- Distribution (how to reach/sell)
- Adoption (path to discovery/adoption)
- Decision maker (who buys and why)
- Role (function of users/champions)
- Core competency (company's zone of mastery)
- Sophistication (prior experience/expectations)
- Geo (location)
- Lifecycle (stage in customer journey)
- Scale (organization size)
- Vertical (industry)

**Do NOT use**:
- Demographics alone
- Psychographics alone
- Composite personas
- "Crossing the chasm" framework

### 5 Tests of Effective Segmentation

1. **Consistent Needs**: Each segment shares similar core needs; unmet needs vary meaningfully across segments
2. **Product-specific**: Tailored to your specific product/category
3. **Targetable**: Predictable and repeatable to identify and target
4. **Prioritizable**: Clear who you can differentiate, target, and resonate with
5. **Winnable**: You can differentiate for this segment

### Segmentation Framework for Decisions

For each plausible segment, evaluate:
- **Differentiation**: Can we differentiate quickly (before next funding round/reorg)?
- **Distribution**: Can we reach and sell to them, and sustain advantage?
- **Future expansion**: Will other segments look like these customers, or is there a credible expansion path?

## Key Principles

- **Most strategy problems are segmentation problems**: Get segmentation right first
- **Segmentation determines needs**: Who you serve determines what needs you must meet
- **Segmentation guides distribution**: Different segments require different channels
- **Segmentation enables differentiation**: Can't differentiate without focused segments
- **Iterate with differentiation**: Hone segments ↔ Hone differentiation (back and forth)
- **Be specific**: Avoid generic segments (company size × vertical)

## Common Pitfalls

- Using demographics alone (B2B: company size × vertical; B2C: demographic × geography)
- Creating segments that aren't targetable
- Not being specific enough
- Not considering distribution access
- Ignoring likelihood of differentiation
- Not iterating between segmentation and differentiation

## Related Frameworks

- **Differentiation**: Segmentation and differentiation iterate together
- **Strategy Creation**: Segmentation is a core step in strategy creation
- **Jobs-to-Be-Done**: Can inform needs-based segmentation
- **Four Fits**: Market-Product fit starts with market segmentation

## Example Use Cases

- **B2B SaaS**: Segment by role (developers vs business users), sophistication (startups vs enterprises), and needs (new integration vs migration)
- **Consumer Product**: Segment by use case (customer comms vs internal collaboration), distribution (self-serve vs sold), and context (hybrid/remote vs office-only)
