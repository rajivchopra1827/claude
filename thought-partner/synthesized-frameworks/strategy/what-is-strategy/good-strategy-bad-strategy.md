# Good Strategy vs Bad Strategy

## Purpose

This framework helps distinguish between effective strategy and ineffective strategy by clearly defining what makes strategy good or bad. It provides a lens for evaluating your own strategy and identifying common pitfalls that lead to bad strategy.

## When to Use

- When evaluating or creating a product strategy
- To identify why a strategy isn't working
- When you need to communicate what good strategy looks like
- To diagnose problems with existing strategic plans
- When you want to avoid common strategy mistakes

## Key Components/Steps

### Good Strategy Characteristics (Rumelt + Shreyas)

**Good Strategy:**
- **A Clear Plan** (not just an aspiration)
- **Diagnoses core problems** - understands users, business, and market situation
- **Clear solution** - defines what you'll actually build to solve problems
- **Actionable and achievable plan** - specific steps to execute
- **Concrete and specific** - not fluffy or high-level
- **Coherent and coordinated** - all parts work together (1+1=3)
- **Leverages unique strengths** - hard to copy
- **Makes trade-offs explicit** - clear about what you're NOT doing
- **Differentiates meaningfully** - concrete choices that make you unique
- **Optimizes for long-term results** - not just near-term consensus

**Bad Strategy:**
- **An Aspiration** (not a plan)
- **Unclear about problems** - doesn't diagnose core issues
- **Just goals** - "raise revenue" without a plan
- **No actual plan** - or plan is unachievable
- **Fluffy and high-level** - "improve UX", "increase alignment"
- **Scrambled mess** - parts don't work together (1+1≤2)
- **Easy to replicate** - tries to copy others
- **Tries to be everything** - "all things to all people"
- **Vague differentiation** - "be the best", "most delightful" without specifics
- **Optimizes for consensus** - people-pleasing instead of direction

### Strategy Kernel (Rumelt)

Good strategy has three essential components:

1. **Diagnosis (Why)**: Analyze the situation and identify key problems
2. **Guiding Policy (What)**: Outline approach to solve problems and create advantage
3. **Coherent Action (How)**: Specific actionable steps to execute the guiding policy

### Shreyas's 21-Point Framework

Shreyas provides 21 specific criteria for evaluating strategy, covering:
- Customer segmentation (target and non-target segments)
- Market assessment (honest about competition and position)
- Needs prioritization (intentional subset, not laundry list)
- Competitive stance (head-to-head vs different turf)
- Trade-offs (explicit rationale)
- Leveraging advantages (companion products, distribution, partners)
- Differentiation (concrete product choices)
- Success indicators (leading and lagging metrics)
- Business impact (company-level upside)
- Execution mapping (choices to action plan)
- Fresh perspective (not just conforming to exec opinions)
- Inspiration (vivid, rigorous, actionable)
- Memorability (easy to remember and repeat)
- Long-term focus (not just near-term consensus)

## Key Principles

- **Strategy is a plan, not a wish**: Must be actionable and achievable
- **Diagnosis comes first**: Can't solve problems you don't understand
- **Trade-offs are essential**: Strategy requires saying no to many good ideas
- **Coherence matters**: All parts must work together
- **Leverage strengths**: Build on what makes you unique
- **Be specific**: Vague strategy is bad strategy
- **Focus on long-term**: Don't optimize for short-term consensus

## Common Pitfalls

- **Mistaking goals for strategy**: "Our strategy is to grow 20%" is a goal, not strategy
- **Template-style strategy**: Fill-in-the-blanks vision/mission/values without real thinking
- **Fluff**: Gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts
- **Failure to face challenges**: Ignoring real problems
- **No trade-offs**: Trying to do everything
- **Copying others**: Not leveraging unique strengths
- **Roadmap confusion**: Strategy isn't just a list of features
- **Taking too long**: "The strategy is coming" creates opposite of clarity

## Related Frameworks

- **Strategy Kernel**: The three-part structure (Diagnosis → Policy → Action)
- **Michael Porter's Strategy**: Focus on differentiation and competitive advantage
- **Gib Biddle's Definition**: "Clear plan to deliver customer value in a differentiated way"
- **Common Pitfalls (Jon D)**: How to avoid screwing up your strategy

## Example Use Cases

- **Evaluating Existing Strategy**: Use the good/bad criteria to assess if your current strategy is effective or needs revision.
- **Strategy Creation**: Use the Strategy Kernel (Diagnosis → Policy → Action) as a structure for building strategy.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Use Shreyas's 21 points as a checklist to ensure your strategy covers all critical elements.
