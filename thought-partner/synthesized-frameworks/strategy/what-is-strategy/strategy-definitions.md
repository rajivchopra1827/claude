# Strategy Definitions

## Purpose

Understanding different definitions of strategy helps clarify what strategy is and what it should accomplish. Multiple perspectives provide a richer understanding than any single definition.

## When to Use

- When you need to explain what strategy is to others
- To clarify your own thinking about strategy
- When creating or evaluating strategy
- To align team understanding of strategy

## Key Definitions

### Your Definition

**"A clear plan to deliver value to customers in a way that's differentiated and grows the business."**

This definition emphasizes:
- **Clear plan**: Actionable, not just aspirations
- **Customer value**: Solving real problems for users
- **Differentiated**: Unique approach that competitors can't easily copy
- **Business growth**: Must contribute to business success

### Gib Biddle's Definition

Gib Biddle defines product strategy through frameworks like DHM (Delight/Hard to Copy/Margin) and GEM (Growth/Engagement/Monetization), emphasizing that strategy must:
- Create customer delight
- Be hard for competitors to copy
- Generate margin/profitability
- Drive growth, engagement, and monetization

### Michael Porter's Definition

**"Strategy explains how an organization, faced with competition, will achieve superior performance."**

Key elements:
- **Superior performance**: Measured by ROIC (Return on Invested Capital), not market share
- **Differentiation**: Ability to charge higher relative price OR operate at lower relative cost
- **Unique value chain**: Different configuration of activities than competitors
- **Trade-offs**: Choices that make strategy sustainable
- **Strategic fit**: Activities reinforce each other

### Strategy vs Other Concepts

**Strategy vs Goals:**
- Goals: "Grow revenue 20%"
- Strategy: The plan for how to achieve that goal

**Strategy vs Roadmap:**
- Roadmap: List of features/projects and timeline
- Strategy: Why those features, for whom, and how they create advantage

**Strategy vs Vision:**
- Vision: Where you want to end up
- Strategy: How you'll get there

**Strategy vs Business Model:**
- Business Model: Relationship between revenues and costs
- Strategy: Relative prices and relative costs, and their sustainability

## Key Principles

- **Strategy is about choices**: What to do AND what not to do
- **Strategy creates advantage**: Through differentiation or cost leadership
- **Strategy is a plan**: Not just goals or aspirations
- **Strategy is unique**: Different from competitors
- **Strategy is sustainable**: Hard to copy or neutralize

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing strategy with goals ("Our strategy is to grow 20%")
- Treating roadmap as strategy (list of features without why)
- Copying competitors instead of being unique
- Trying to be everything to everyone (no trade-offs)
- Focusing on market share instead of profitability

## Related Frameworks

- **Good Strategy vs Bad Strategy**: How to evaluate if strategy is effective
- **Strategy Kernel**: The structure of good strategy (Diagnosis → Policy → Action)
- **Michael Porter's Competitive Strategy**: Framework for achieving superior performance
- **Gib Biddle's Frameworks**: DHM, GEM, GLEe models

## Example Use Cases

- **Team Alignment**: Use definitions to ensure everyone understands what strategy means in your context.
- **Strategy Creation**: Start with a clear definition to guide your strategy development process.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Use definitions to explain strategy to executives, board, or investors.
