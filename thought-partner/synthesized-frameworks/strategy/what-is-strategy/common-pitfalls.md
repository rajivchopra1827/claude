# Common Strategy Pitfalls

## Purpose

Understanding common mistakes in strategy creation helps you avoid them. This framework identifies frequent failure modes and provides guidance on how to prevent them.

## When to Use

- When creating a new strategy
- To evaluate an existing strategy for problems
- When your strategy isn't working as expected
- To prevent common mistakes before they happen
- When reviewing strategy with your team

## Key Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. Strategy Takes Too Long to Create

**Problem**: "The product strategy is coming" - teams delay creating strategy because it's hard work, requiring deep expertise, focused time, collaboration, and market understanding.

**Solution**: 
- Always have a working strategy, even if temporary
- Start with a temporary strategy based on best current thinking
- Be upfront that it's temporary and will improve
- Iterate and refine over time rather than waiting for perfection

### 2. Strategy is Just a Roadmap

**Problem**: Leaders treat strategy as a communication exercise, sharing themes and roadmaps without the deeper thinking that makes it strategy.

**Solution**:
- Strategy is more than a list of things to do
- Include diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent actions
- Explain WHY features, not just WHAT features
- Connect roadmap items to strategic objectives

### 3. Strategy is Just Goals

**Problem**: Leaders confuse goals ("grow revenue 20%") with strategy (the plan to achieve that goal).

**Solution**:
- Goals should emerge from strategy, not be the strategy
- Strategy explains HOW you'll achieve goals
- Use goals alongside strategy, not instead of it
- Strategy is the most foundational coordination tool

### 4. No Trade-offs

**Problem**: Strategy tries to be "all things to all people" without making hard choices about what NOT to do.

**Solution**:
- Make explicit what you're NOT doing
- Include a "What we're not doing" section
- Recognize that saying no to good ideas is essential
- Focus on few things with enough vigor to make a difference

### 5. Ignoring Competitive Advantages

**Problem**: Strategy doesn't leverage or build on existing advantages (network effects, cost differentials, unique capabilities).

**Solution**:
- Identify your structural advantages
- Build strategy that leverages these advantages consistently
- Think about what competitors can't easily replicate
- Consider network effects, cost differentials, and unique capabilities

### 6. Not Addressing Obstacles

**Problem**: Strategy doesn't acknowledge or plan for overcoming major obstacles (product-market fit issues, strong competitors).

**Solution**:
- Outline bets you'll make even if not fully understood yet
- Address how you'll overcome known obstacles
- Strategy should be a plan to succeed in your actual environment
- It's fine for strategy to be incomplete, but continue working on it

### 7. Poor Buy-in Process

**Problem**: Strategy doesn't get buy-in from the right people, or gets diluted by too many contributors.

**Solution**:
- Get buy-in from key partners (engineering, business/sales, execs)
- Balance buy-in with avoiding groupthink
- Work with single partners to assess capacity and skill gaps
- Don't let strategy become long collective bargaining effort

### 8. Not Updating Regularly

**Problem**: Strategy becomes stale as market conditions change, but teams don't revise it.

**Solution**:
- Update strategy regularly as you learn
- Be flexible when underlying assumptions prove inaccurate
- Be confident in what you propose but flexible to change
- Know when to adapt vs when to stay the course

## Key Principles

- **Start with something**: Temporary strategy is better than no strategy
- **Make it actionable**: Strategy must be a plan, not just goals or roadmap
- **Make trade-offs explicit**: Say no to many good ideas
- **Leverage advantages**: Build on what makes you unique
- **Address obstacles**: Don't ignore major challenges
- **Get right buy-in**: Balance collaboration with focus
- **Keep it current**: Update as conditions change

## Common Pitfalls

- Waiting for perfect information before creating strategy
- Treating strategy as a one-time exercise
- Confusing strategy with other coordination tools (goals, roadmaps)
- Not making hard choices about what to exclude
- Ignoring competitive advantages or obstacles
- Getting too many people involved (dilutes strategy)
- Not updating strategy as you learn
