# Stakeholder Messaging & Communication

## Purpose

Effective stakeholder communication ensures the right people have the right information at the right time. This framework covers principles and practices for communicating product strategy, progress, and decisions to various stakeholders.

## When to Use

- When communicating strategy to stakeholders
- For regular stakeholder updates
- When preparing for all-hands or executive meetings
- To align cross-functional partners
- When you need buy-in or feedback

## Key Components/Steps

### Communication Principles

- **Over-communicate**: Err on side of visibility
- **Organized communication**: Keep things organized so people don't miss important info
- **Right channel for right purpose**: Use appropriate channels (Slack, docs, meetings)
- **Regular cadence**: Establish regular update rhythms
- **Pre-work**: Prepare updates ahead of time

### Communication Channels

**Slack**:
- Use project channels (#prj-[name]) for initiative communication
- Use threads to organize discussion
- Use @tags to indicate action needed
- Use bookmarks for important docs

**Documents**:
- Written strategy documents
- Roadmaps
- Status updates
- Decision logs

**Meetings**:
- Regular stakeholder updates (bi-weekly, monthly)
- All-hands presentations
- Strategy roadshows
- Listening tours

### Stakeholder Update Structure

**Key Elements**:
- **Progress tracking**: What's been done, what's in progress
- **Updates/learnings**: Key insights from recent work
- **Next steps**: What's coming next, with owners and dates
- **Questions for feedback**: What do you need from stakeholders?

### All-Hands Preparation

**Key Elements**:
- Clear narrative about strategy/direction
- Visual artifacts (videos, prototypes)
- Progress and learnings
- What's next
- Q&A preparation

## Key Principles

- **Repetition helps**: Strategy benefits from repetition
- **Show, don't just tell**: Use visual artifacts
- **Right level of detail**: Different stakeholders need different detail levels
- **Two-way communication**: Listen as much as you share
- **Timely updates**: Don't wait until things are perfect

## Common Pitfalls

- Not communicating enough (under-communication)
- Communicating too much detail (overwhelming)
- Wrong channel for message
- Not preparing for meetings
- One-way communication (not listening)
- Waiting for perfection before sharing
