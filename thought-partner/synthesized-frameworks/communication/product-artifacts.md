# Product Artifacts

## Purpose

Product artifacts are communication tools that help give and gain clarity. They translate strategy and thinking into formats that teams can understand, remember, and use to make decisions. Different artifacts serve different purposes in product communication.

## When to Use

- When communicating strategy to teams
- To make complex information clear and memorable
- When you need to align stakeholders
- To document thinking and decisions
- When preparing for meetings or presentations

## Key Components/Steps

### Vision Artifacts

**Purpose**: Communication tool for your strategy

**Key Points**:
- Vision comes AFTER strategy (not before)
- Process: Have high-level vision in mind → Formulate strategy → Paint full vision
- Vision = vivid description of main bets of strategy & beyond
- Most people won't understand strategy document, but will understand vision

**Formats**:
- Video (most powerful)
- Text
- Storyboards (StoryboardThat)

**Examples**: Asana, Roblox, Project Astra, John Deere visions

### Product Proposals

**Amazon 5Qs**:
1. Who is the customer?
2. What is the problem/opportunity?
3. What is the main customer benefit?
4. How do you know customers want this?
5. What is the customer experience?

**Purpose**: Structure product proposals to ensure all critical questions are answered

### PRFAQs (Press Release / FAQ)

**Purpose**: 
- For large orgs, need to think big
- For thinking backwards & thinking about messaging
- Write press release and FAQ as if product already launched

**Key**: Forces you to think about customer value and messaging upfront

### Lo-Fi Prototypes

**Tools**: Draw.io, Balsamiq, FigJam

**Purpose**: Visualize ideas quickly without high-fidelity design

### Structured Thinking Artifacts

**Types**:
- Flowcharts
- Tables
- 2x2s, 3x3s (matrices)

**Purpose**: Turn confusing information into clear structures

**Key Insight**: "If you can turn confusing information into these, you are good"

## Key Principles

- **Clarity over completeness**: Better to be clear than comprehensive
- **Right format for right purpose**: Different artifacts for different needs
- **Visual > text**: Visual artifacts are more memorable
- **Customer language**: Use language customers understand
- **Think backwards**: PRFAQs help think from customer perspective

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating vision before strategy (wrong order)
- Too much text, not enough visuals
- Using internal jargon instead of customer language
- Not thinking backwards (PRFAQs)
- Over-complicating artifacts (defeats purpose)

## Related Frameworks

- **Strategy Creation**: Artifacts communicate strategy
- **Vision Creation**: Vision is a key artifact
- **Communication**: Artifacts are communication tools
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Use artifacts in updates

## Example Use Cases

- **Strategy Communication**: Create vision video to communicate strategy to company
- **Product Proposal**: Use Amazon 5Qs to structure feature proposal
- **Large Initiative**: Write PRFAQ for major product launch
- **Complex Problem**: Create flowchart to explain complex process
