# Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD)

## Purpose

Jobs-to-Be-Done is a framework for understanding why customers "hire" products or services. It shifts focus from customer demographics to the functional, emotional, and social jobs customers are trying to accomplish. This helps teams build products that customers actually want to use.

## When to Use

- When you need to understand why customers switch to your product
- During product discovery to identify unmet customer needs
- When positioning or messaging isn't resonating
- To identify innovation opportunities in "struggling moments"
- When you want to understand the full customer journey, not just product usage

## Key Components/Steps

### Theory Components

1. **The Job**: The progress a customer is trying to make in a particular circumstance
2. **Functional Job**: The practical task they're trying to accomplish
3. **Emotional Job**: How they want to feel or avoid feeling
4. **Social Job**: How they want to be perceived by others

### Interview Process (Bob Moesta)

1. **Start at the End**: Ask "What did you buy?" / "When did you buy?" / "Where did you buy?"
2. **Go to the Beginning**: Ask "When did you first decide you wanted [X]?"
3. **Map the Timeline**: Understand the sequence of events leading to purchase
4. **Identify Forces**:
   - **Push**: The situation pushing them away from current solution
   - **Pull**: The new solution pulling them in
   - **Anxiety**: Concerns about the new solution
   - **Habit**: What they need to give up
5. **Understand Looking Stages**:
   - **Passive Looking**: Problem aware, solution unaware
   - **Active Looking**: Problem aware, solution aware
   - **Deciding**: Evaluating trade-offs
   - **First Use**: Initial experience
   - **Ongoing Use**: Long-term engagement

## Key Principles

- **Focus on struggling moments**: Innovation happens where customers struggle
- **Choose what to suck at**: Make strategic trade-offs customers are willing to accept
- **Sell based on how people want to buy**: Meet customers where they are in their buying process
- **Context matters more than demographics**: Same person has different jobs in different contexts
- **Don't hypothesize jobs**: Go talk to people who've actually bought/switched

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing features with jobs (a job is the progress, not the solution)
- Interviewing people who haven't actually made a purchase decision
- Using a rigid discussion guide instead of following the story
- Focusing on demographics instead of context and circumstances
- Assuming you know the job without talking to customers

## Related Frameworks

- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: JTBD helps identify opportunities in the problem space
- **Strategy Creation**: HBS uses JTBD as a foundation for strategy creation
- **Segmentation**: Segment by jobs customers are trying to do, not demographics
- **Product Delight**: Understanding jobs helps identify delight opportunities

## Example Use Cases

- **Car Purchase**: The job isn't "own a car" but "get to work reliably when public transit fails" (functional), "feel independent" (emotional), "appear responsible" (social). The struggling moment: missing a train with a baby.
- **Product Adoption**: A customer switches from Tool A to Tool B not because of features, but because Tool B helps them "look competent in front of their boss" (social job) during a presentation.
