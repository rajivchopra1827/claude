# Design Sprints

## Purpose

Design Sprints provide a structured, time-boxed process (typically 4-5 days) to rapidly go from problem to tested prototype. They compress months of work into days by focusing on the most critical decisions and using rapid prototyping and user testing.

## When to Use

- When you need to quickly validate a product idea or feature
- For high-stakes decisions that need rapid testing
- When teams are stuck in analysis paralysis
- To align cross-functional teams around a shared vision
- When you need to test assumptions quickly before building

## Key Components/Steps

### Remote Design Sprint Structure (AJ&Smart)

**Day 1: Understand & Define**
- Map the problem
- Choose a target
- Set success metrics

**Day 2: Diverge**
- Generate ideas individually
- Sketch solutions
- Create solution concepts

**Day 3: Decide**
- Critique and discuss solutions
- Vote on best concepts
- Create storyboard

**Day 4: Prototype**
- Build a realistic prototype
- Focus on key user flows
- Prepare for testing

**Day 5: Validate**
- Test with real users
- Gather feedback
- Decide next steps

## Key Principles

- **Time-boxed**: Fixed duration creates focus and prevents overthinking
- **User-centered**: Every decision is validated with real users
- **Prototype, don't build**: Create realistic but lightweight prototypes
- **Decide by voting**: Use structured decision-making, not consensus
- **Individual then group**: Generate ideas individually before discussing

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping user testing on Day 5
- Building too much in the prototype (should be just enough to test)
- Not having the right people in the room (need decision-makers)
- Rushing through understanding to get to solutions
- Treating the sprint as the end rather than the beginning

## Related Frameworks

- **Double Diamond**: Design sprints follow the explore-then-focus pattern
- **Assumption Mapping**: Helps identify what to test in the sprint
- **Jobs-to-Be-Done**: Understanding jobs informs sprint problem definition
- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Sprints can focus on specific opportunities

## Example Use Cases

- **New Product Feature**: Use a sprint to quickly test if a feature idea solves a real user problem before committing engineering resources.
- **Product Redesign**: Sprint to test a new design direction with users before full implementation.
- **Strategic Decision**: Use a sprint to prototype and test a strategic bet (e.g., new business model, new user segment).
