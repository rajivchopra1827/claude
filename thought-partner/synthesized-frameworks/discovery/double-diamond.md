# Double Diamond

## Purpose

The Double Diamond framework visualizes the product discovery and design process as two phases of divergence (exploring) and convergence (focusing). It helps teams avoid jumping to solutions too quickly and ensures they explore the problem space before converging on solutions.

## When to Use

- At the start of a new product or feature initiative
- When teams are jumping to solutions without understanding the problem
- To structure discovery workshops and design sprints
- When you need to balance exploration with focus
- To communicate the discovery process to stakeholders

## Key Components/Steps

The framework consists of **four phases**:

### First Diamond: Problem Space

1. **Discover (Divergence)**: Explore the problem broadly through research, interviews, and observation
2. **Define (Convergence)**: Synthesize insights to define the core problem to solve

### Second Diamond: Solution Space

3. **Develop (Divergence)**: Generate multiple potential solutions through ideation
4. **Deliver (Convergence)**: Test, refine, and select the best solution to build

## Key Principles

- **Explore before converging**: Spend time in divergence before narrowing focus
- **Problem first**: Fully understand the problem before ideating solutions
- **Multiple options**: Generate many ideas before selecting one
- **Visual representation**: The diamond shape emphasizes the expand-then-focus pattern
- **Iterative**: You may cycle through diamonds multiple times as you learn

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping the first diamond and jumping straight to solutions
- Not spending enough time in divergence phases
- Converging too quickly without exploring enough options
- Treating it as a linear process rather than iterative
- Not involving users in the discover and develop phases

## Related Frameworks

- **Design Sprints**: Use Double Diamond structure within sprint phases
- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Maps to the problem space (first diamond) and solution space (second diamond)
- **Assumption Mapping**: Helps during the define and develop phases
- **Continuous Discovery**: Double Diamond can be applied continuously, not just at project start

## Example Use Cases

- **New Feature**: Discover phase = user interviews and analytics review. Define phase = identify core user need. Develop phase = brainstorm multiple solutions. Deliver phase = prototype and test the best solution.
- **Product Redesign**: Discover = understand current pain points. Define = identify key problems to solve. Develop = explore different design directions. Deliver = implement and validate chosen direction.
