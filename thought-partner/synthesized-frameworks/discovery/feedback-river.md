# Feedback River

## Purpose

Feedback River is a framework for designing a continuous feedback loop that captures customer insights from multiple sources. It helps product teams systematically gather, organize, and act on customer feedback rather than relying on ad-hoc methods.

## When to Use

- When you need to systematize how you collect customer feedback
- To ensure you're not missing important customer signals
- When feedback feels scattered across different channels
- To build a continuous discovery practice
- When you want to reduce bias by gathering feedback from diverse sources

## Key Components/Steps

The framework identifies **10 Common Sources** of customer feedback:

1. **Customer Interviews**: Direct conversations with users
2. **Customer Surveys**: Structured quantitative and qualitative feedback
3. **Customer Support**: Issues, complaints, and questions from support tickets
4. **Customer Metrics**: Behavioral data from analytics
5. **Feedback Forums**: Community discussions and feature requests
6. **Sales**: Insights from sales conversations and objections
7. **Employee Feedback**: Internal team observations and insights
8. **Social Media**: Public conversations and mentions
9. **Customer Success**: Insights from success managers about customer health
10. **Churn Surveys**: Exit interviews and cancellation feedback

## Key Principles

- **Multiple sources**: No single source tells the whole story
- **Continuous flow**: Feedback should be gathered continuously, not just during projects
- **Systematic collection**: Design processes to capture feedback from each source
- **Synthesis**: Combine insights from multiple sources to identify patterns
- **Action-oriented**: Feedback should inform product decisions, not just be collected

## Common Pitfalls

- Relying on only one or two feedback sources
- Collecting feedback but not synthesizing or acting on it
- Treating feedback collection as a one-time activity
- Ignoring negative feedback or churn signals
- Not connecting feedback to product outcomes

## Related Frameworks

- **Continuous Discovery Habits**: Feedback River supports continuous discovery practices
- **Analytics**: Customer metrics are one source in the feedback river
- **User Research**: Customer interviews are a key source
- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Feedback helps identify opportunities

## Example Use Cases

- **SaaS Product**: Combine support tickets (showing pain points), customer success insights (showing success patterns), churn surveys (showing why people leave), and metrics (showing behavior) to identify the most impactful improvements.
- **E-commerce**: Use sales conversations (objections), customer surveys (satisfaction), social media (sentiment), and metrics (conversion funnel) to understand the full customer experience.
