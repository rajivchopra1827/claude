# Discovery Principles & Activities

## Purpose

Discovery Principles provide foundational guidelines for effective product discovery work. They help teams understand what good discovery looks like and how to structure discovery activities to maximize learning and minimize waste.

## When to Use

- When establishing discovery practices on a team
- To guide how you approach discovery work
- When training new team members on discovery
- To evaluate if your discovery process is effective
- As a framework for structuring discovery activities

## Key Principles (Ant Murphy)

Discovery work should be:

1. **Outcome-focused**: Aligned with business goals and user needs
2. **Evidence-based**: Grounded in data and user research, not assumptions
3. **Collaborative**: Involves cross-functional team members
4. **Iterative**: Continuous learning and refinement
5. **User-centered**: Prioritizes solving real user problems

## Key Activities

Discovery activities typically fall into categories:

- **Understanding Users**: Interviews, surveys, observation, analytics
- **Exploring Problems**: Problem framing, opportunity identification, user journey mapping
- **Generating Solutions**: Ideation, prototyping, concept testing
- **Validating Ideas**: Experiments, A/B tests, usability testing
- **Synthesizing Learnings**: Affinity mapping, insight synthesis, opportunity mapping

## Key Principles

- **Start with problems, not solutions**: Understand the problem deeply before ideating
- **Talk to users regularly**: Not just during projects, but continuously
- **Test assumptions quickly**: Use lightweight experiments before building
- **Visualize thinking**: Use diagrams, maps, and visual frameworks
- **Collaborate across functions**: Include design, engineering, and other perspectives

## Common Pitfalls

- Jumping to solutions before understanding problems
- Doing discovery only at project start (not continuously)
- Not involving the whole team in discovery
- Relying on internal opinions instead of user evidence
- Not synthesizing learnings into actionable insights

## Related Frameworks

- **Continuous Discovery Habits**: Principles support building discovery habits
- **Double Diamond**: Principles align with explore-then-focus approach
- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Visual framework for discovery work
- **Jobs-to-Be-Done**: User-centered discovery approach
- **Assumption Mapping**: Evidence-based validation of assumptions

## Example Use Cases

- **Team Onboarding**: Use principles to explain discovery approach to new team members.
- **Process Evaluation**: Assess if current discovery practices align with principles.
- **Activity Planning**: Structure discovery activities around these principles (e.g., "This week we'll focus on understanding users through interviews").
