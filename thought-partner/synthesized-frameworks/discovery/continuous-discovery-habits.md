# Continuous Discovery Habits

## Purpose

Continuous Discovery Habits establish a regular practice of understanding customers and testing ideas, rather than treating discovery as a one-time activity at the start of projects. They ensure teams stay connected to users and make evidence-based decisions continuously.

## When to Use

- To build a sustainable discovery practice (not just ad-hoc research)
- When you want to avoid building features users don't want
- To maintain customer connection throughout product development
- When you need to balance discovery with delivery
- To create a culture of experimentation and learning

## Key Principles (Theresa Torres)

1. **Outcome Oriented**: Focus on work that drives business outcomes, not just delivering outputs
2. **Customer Centric**: Solve problems for users, not just for the business
3. **Experimental**: Be hypothesis-driven and test quickly to gather evidence before investing
4. **Collaborative**: Everyone helps shape what you build and why, not just how
5. **Continuous**: Do discovery continuously, not just at the "beginning" of big projects
6. **Structured & Visual**: Align and address ambiguity by visualizing thinking in space (not just words)

## Key Components/Steps

### Weekly Discovery Habits

- **Talk to customers weekly**: Regular customer interviews (not just during projects)
- **Test ideas weekly**: Run small experiments continuously
- **Synthesize learnings**: Regularly update opportunity solution trees and assumption maps
- **Share insights**: Communicate findings with the team continuously

### Tools & Practices

- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Visualize opportunities and solutions
- **Assumption Mapping**: Identify and test risky assumptions
- **Customer Interviews**: Regular conversations with users
- **Lightweight Experiments**: Quick tests before building

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating discovery as a phase rather than a continuous practice
- Only doing discovery at the start of projects
- Not involving the whole team in discovery
- Focusing on outputs (features) instead of outcomes
- Not making discovery a regular habit (easy to skip when busy)

## Related Frameworks

- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Core tool for continuous discovery
- **Assumption Mapping**: Regular assumption testing
- **Feedback River**: Continuous feedback collection
- **Jobs-to-Be-Done**: Regular customer interviews using JTBD
- **Design Sprints**: Can be part of continuous discovery, not replacement

## Example Use Cases

- **Weekly Customer Interviews**: Instead of doing 20 interviews at project start, do 2-3 interviews every week to stay connected to users.
- **Continuous Experimentation**: Run small tests weekly (prototypes, concierge tests) rather than waiting for big A/B tests.
- **Living Opportunity Solution Trees**: Update OSTs weekly as you learn, not just create them once at project start.
