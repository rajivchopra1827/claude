# Analytics & Diagnostics

## Purpose

Analytics and diagnostic processes help teams understand what's happening with their product metrics, identify issues quickly, and make data-informed decisions. They turn raw data into actionable insights.

## When to Use

- When metrics change unexpectedly (up or down)
- To understand user behavior patterns
- When you need to diagnose why a feature isn't performing
- To identify opportunities for improvement
- For regular metric monitoring and reporting

## Key Components/Steps

### Conversion Rate Decline Diagnostic (Elena Verna)

1. **Identify the Change**: Notice metric fluctuation (e.g., conversion rate drop)
2. **Set 48-Hour Window**: Commit to investigating within 48 hours
3. **Segment Analysis**: Break down by:
   - User segments (new vs returning, demographics)
   - Traffic sources (organic, paid, direct)
   - Device types (mobile, desktop, tablet)
   - Geographic regions
   - Time periods (day of week, time of day)
4. **Identify Root Cause**: Find the specific segment or factor causing the change
5. **Investigate Further**: Dig into that segment to understand why
6. **Communicate Findings**: Share clear, timely updates with stakeholders
7. **Take Action**: Fix the issue or decide if it's acceptable

## Key Principles

- **Speed matters**: Investigate metric changes quickly (48-hour rule)
- **Segment everything**: Aggregate metrics hide important patterns
- **Correlation vs causation**: Data shows what, not why (need qualitative research too)
- **Regular monitoring**: Don't wait for problems, proactively track metrics
- **Clear communication**: Translate data insights into actionable language

## Common Pitfalls

- Only looking at aggregate metrics (missing segment-level insights)
- Not investigating quickly (problems compound over time)
- Confusing correlation with causation
- Not combining quantitative data with qualitative research
- Over-analyzing without taking action

## Related Frameworks

- **A/B Testing**: Analytics help identify what to test
- **Feedback River**: Combine analytics (metrics) with qualitative feedback
- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Analytics help identify opportunities
- **Continuous Discovery**: Regular analytics review is a discovery habit

## Example Use Cases

- **Conversion Drop**: Analytics show 20% drop in checkout completion. Diagnostic reveals it's only affecting mobile users in a specific region. Further investigation shows a payment provider issue in that region.
- **Feature Adoption**: Analytics show low feature usage. Segmentation reveals it's only low among new users, suggesting an onboarding issue rather than a feature problem.
