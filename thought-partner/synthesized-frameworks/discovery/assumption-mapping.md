# Assumption Mapping

## Purpose

Assumption Mapping helps teams identify, prioritize, and test the riskiest assumptions underlying their product ideas. It ensures teams validate the most critical unknowns before investing significant resources in building solutions.

## When to Use

- Before building a new product or feature
- When you have multiple solution ideas and need to prioritize which to test first
- To identify what you don't know but are assuming
- When you need to design experiments to validate ideas
- During solution ideation to surface hidden assumptions

## Key Components/Steps

1. **List Assumptions**: Brainstorm all assumptions underlying your product idea
2. **Map by Importance & Evidence**:
   - **High Importance, Low Evidence**: Riskiest assumptions (test these first)
   - **High Importance, High Evidence**: Validate but lower priority
   - **Low Importance**: Can be deferred
3. **Design Experiments**: Create tests to validate the riskiest assumptions
4. **Run Experiments**: Execute tests to gather evidence
5. **Update Map**: Revise assumptions based on learnings

## Key Principles

- **Assumptions are everywhere**: Every product idea contains assumptions about users, problems, solutions, and business
- **Test the riskiest first**: Focus validation efforts on high-importance, low-evidence assumptions
- **Evidence over opinions**: Use data and user feedback, not internal debates
- **Fast and cheap**: Design lightweight experiments, not full builds
- **Continuous**: Assumptions change as you learn, so keep mapping

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming you know what users want without testing
- Testing low-importance assumptions while ignoring risky ones
- Designing expensive experiments when cheap ones would suffice
- Not updating the map as you learn new information
- Confusing assumptions with facts

## Related Frameworks

- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Assumptions exist at both opportunity and solution levels
- **A/B Testing**: One method for testing assumptions
- **Design Sprints**: Assumption mapping fits into the develop phase
- **Continuous Discovery**: Regular assumption mapping prevents building the wrong thing

## Example Use Cases

- **New Feature**: Assumption = "Users want to share content on social media". Importance = High (core feature). Evidence = Low (never asked users). Test = User interviews asking about sharing behavior.
- **Product Launch**: Assumption = "Customers will pay $X for this solution". Importance = High (business model). Evidence = Low (no pricing research). Test = Concierge test or pricing survey.
