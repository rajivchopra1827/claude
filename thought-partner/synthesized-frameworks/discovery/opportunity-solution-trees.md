# Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)

## Purpose

Opportunity Solution Trees help product teams visualize the relationship between desired outcomes, user opportunities, and potential solutions. They provide a structured way to explore the problem space before jumping to solutions, ensuring teams focus on solving the right problems.

## When to Use

- When you have a clear outcome goal but need to explore multiple paths to achieve it
- During discovery to map out opportunities before ideating solutions
- When prioritizing which problems to solve first
- To align teams around a shared understanding of the problem space
- When you need to connect outcomes to specific user opportunities

## Key Components/Steps

1. **Start with an Outcome**: Define the measurable outcome you want to achieve (e.g., "Increase user activation rate")
2. **Identify Opportunities**: Brainstorm user opportunities that could lead to this outcome
3. **Generate Solutions**: For each opportunity, generate multiple potential solutions
4. **Prioritize**: Use prioritization frameworks (like ICE) to rank opportunities and solutions
5. **Test & Iterate**: Validate assumptions through experiments and user research

## Key Principles

- **Outcome-first thinking**: Always start with the desired outcome, not features
- **Multiple paths**: There are usually multiple opportunities that could lead to the same outcome
- **Solution diversity**: Generate multiple solutions for each opportunity before converging
- **Visual structure**: The tree structure makes relationships and trade-offs visible
- **Continuous refinement**: Update the tree as you learn more from experiments and user feedback

## Common Pitfalls

- Jumping to solutions before exploring opportunities
- Creating too many branches without prioritization
- Not connecting opportunities back to measurable outcomes
- Treating the tree as static rather than a living document
- Focusing on features instead of user opportunities

## Related Frameworks

- **ICE Prioritization**: Used to prioritize opportunities and solutions within the tree
- **Jobs-to-Be-Done**: Helps identify opportunities by understanding user jobs
- **Assumption Mapping**: Validates assumptions within opportunities and solutions
- **Continuous Discovery Habits**: OST is a core tool in continuous discovery practices

## Example Use Cases

- **E-commerce**: Outcome = "Increase checkout completion rate". Opportunities might include "Reduce checkout friction", "Build trust during checkout", "Simplify payment options". Solutions for "Reduce checkout friction" could include one-click checkout, guest checkout, or saved payment methods.
- **SaaS**: Outcome = "Improve user activation". Opportunities might include "Reduce time to value", "Improve onboarding clarity", "Increase feature discovery". Solutions for "Reduce time to value" could include templates, guided tours, or pre-filled data.
