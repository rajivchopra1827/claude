# Weighted Cost of Delay / Urgency Prioritization

## Purpose

Weighted Cost of Delay prioritization adds urgency as a critical dimension to prioritization decisions. It helps teams recognize that not all high-value work is equally urgent, and that delaying some work has higher costs than others. This prevents teams from always prioritizing "high value" work while missing time-sensitive opportunities or blockers.

## When to Use

- When you have work with time-sensitive constraints
- To prioritize between work that enables other opportunities vs. standalone value
- When competition or market timing matters
- To identify blockers that are preventing other work
- When you need to balance value with timing considerations

## Key Components/Steps

### Prioritization Formula

**Priority = Urgency × Value**

Both Urgency and Value are scored (typically 1-5 or 1-10), and multiplied together.

### Urgency Drivers

1. **Time Constraints**: 
   - Regulation changes with deadlines
   - Deprecating technology that must be migrated
   - Contractual obligations or commitments
   - Seasonal timing requirements

2. **Competition / Risk of Abandonment**:
   - Falling behind competitors
   - Losing brand credibility
   - Market window closing
   - Customer churn risk

3. **Learnings / Enablement**:
   - Is this a hard blocker for other high-value work?
   - Does this unlock future opportunities?
   - Will delaying this prevent learning that informs other decisions?
   - Does this enable a critical path?

## Key Principles

- **Urgency is independent of value**: High-value work can have low urgency, and vice versa
- **Cost of delay matters**: Some work costs more to delay than others, even if value is similar
- **Enablement value**: Work that unlocks other opportunities has higher urgency
- **Time windows**: Some opportunities have expiration dates
- **Context matters**: Same work can have different urgency in different contexts

## Common Pitfalls

- Only prioritizing by value and ignoring urgency
- Not recognizing enablement/blocker urgency
- Treating all work as equally urgent (or not urgent)
- Missing time-sensitive opportunities
- Not updating urgency scores as deadlines approach

## Related Frameworks

- **ICE Prioritization**: Can incorporate urgency into the Impact score, or use alongside ICE
- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: Urgency helps prioritize which opportunities to tackle first
- **Roadmaps**: Urgency informs sequencing and timeline decisions
- **Strategy**: Urgency aligns with strategic timing and competitive positioning

## Example Use Cases

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Low user value but extremely high urgency due to legal deadline. Must be prioritized despite low value score.
- **Platform Migration**: Enables future features (high enablement urgency) even if current value is moderate. Prioritize to unlock future work.
- **Competitive Feature**: Moderate value but high urgency due to competitor launch. Prioritize to maintain market position.
- **Hard Blocker**: Low direct value but high urgency because it blocks multiple high-value features. Prioritize to unblock other work.
