# Opportunity Solution Tree Prioritization

## Purpose

Opportunity Solution Tree Prioritization provides a framework for prioritizing both opportunities and solutions within an Opportunity Solution Tree. It helps teams focus on the most impactful opportunities first, then identify the best solutions for those opportunities.

## When to Use

- When you have an Opportunity Solution Tree with multiple opportunities
- To decide which opportunities to tackle first
- To prioritize solutions within a chosen opportunity
- When you need to balance opportunity impact with solution feasibility
- To make prioritization decisions visible and transparent

## Key Components/Steps

### Prioritizing Opportunities

1. **Assess Opportunity Impact**: How much would solving this opportunity contribute to your outcome?
2. **Consider Opportunity Size**: How many users would benefit? How often?
3. **Evaluate Opportunity Urgency**: Is this opportunity time-sensitive?
4. **Rank Opportunities**: Prioritize opportunities that have high impact, size, and/or urgency

### Prioritizing Solutions

1. **Assess Solution Impact**: How well does this solution address the opportunity?
2. **Evaluate Solution Feasibility**: How easy is this solution to build and test?
3. **Consider Solution Risk**: What assumptions does this solution rely on?
4. **Rank Solutions**: Prioritize solutions that have high impact, high feasibility, and lower risk

### Integration with Other Frameworks

- Use **ICE Prioritization** to score opportunities and solutions
- Apply **Assumption Mapping** to identify risky solutions
- Use **Weighted Cost of Delay** to factor in urgency
- Consider **Jobs-to-Be-Done** insights when assessing opportunity impact

## Key Principles

- **Opportunity-first**: Prioritize opportunities before solutions (solve the right problem)
- **Multiple solutions**: Generate multiple solutions per opportunity before prioritizing
- **Evidence-based**: Use data and user research to inform prioritization
- **Visual prioritization**: Make prioritization visible in the tree structure
- **Continuous refinement**: Update priorities as you learn more

## Common Pitfalls

- Prioritizing solutions before understanding opportunity impact
- Not generating enough solutions before prioritizing
- Prioritizing based on opinions rather than evidence
- Ignoring the tree structure (prioritizing in isolation)
- Not updating priorities as new information emerges

## Related Frameworks

- **Opportunity Solution Trees**: This is prioritization within the OST framework
- **ICE Prioritization**: Use ICE scores to prioritize opportunities and solutions
- **Assumption Mapping**: Prioritize solutions with fewer/less risky assumptions
- **Weighted Cost of Delay**: Factor urgency into opportunity prioritization
- **Jobs-to-Be-Done**: Use JTBD insights to assess opportunity impact

## Example Use Cases

- **E-commerce Checkout**: Outcome = "Increase checkout completion". Opportunity "Reduce checkout friction" ranks higher than "Add social sharing" based on impact. Within "Reduce friction", solution "Guest checkout" ranks higher than "One-click checkout" based on feasibility.
- **SaaS Activation**: Outcome = "Improve user activation". Opportunity "Reduce time to value" prioritized over "Improve onboarding clarity" based on impact. Within "Reduce time to value", solution "Pre-filled templates" prioritized over "AI-powered setup" based on feasibility and risk.
