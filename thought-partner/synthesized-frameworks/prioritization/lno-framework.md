# LNO Framework: Leverage, Neutral, Overhead

## Purpose

The LNO Framework helps product leaders determine how much effort to invest in tasks. It addresses the reality that for senior PMs, time scarcity is structural—there's always an infinite list of valuable things to do. The framework helps answer "how much effort should I invest?" alongside "what should I work on?"

## When to Use

- Planning daily/weekly work
- Deciding how much time to invest in tasks
- Managing workload as a product leader
- Avoiding over-investment in low-leverage work
- Protecting time for high-impact activities

## Key Components

### L (Leverage ~10X) - "Do a great job. Let your inner perfectionist shine."

**Definition**: Tasks where a small amount of effort creates roughly 10 times the impact.

**Characteristics**:
- Strategic decisions that shape direction
- High-stakes stakeholder management (only you can handle)
- Work that unlocks other high-value initiatives
- Unique expertise/knowledge required (only you have)
- High visibility outcomes where quality creates disproportionate value
- Things that create systems/processes others will follow

**Effort Investment**: Focus deeply. Invest significant time and energy. Let your inner perfectionist shine.

**Examples**:
- Creating a product strategy framework
- Making a critical architectural decision
- Presenting to executive stakeholders
- Designing a new process that others will follow
- Strategic planning sessions

### N (Neutral ~1X) - "Do a strictly good job. No better."

**Definition**: Tasks where effort invested roughly equals impact achieved (~1X multiplier).

**Characteristics**:
- Routine execution that needs to happen
- Good enough quality is sufficient
- Others could do similar quality work
- Necessary but not a force multiplier
- Standard quality bar is appropriate

**Effort Investment**: Do a good job. No better. Meet the standard, don't exceed it unnecessarily.

**Examples**:
- Routine status updates
- Standard meeting preparation
- Reviewing standard documentation
- Coordinating routine activities
- Following up on standard requests

### O (Overhead <1X) - "Just get it done. Actively try to do a bad job."

**Definition**: Tasks where effort invested yields less impact than the effort itself (<1X multiplier).

**Characteristics**:
- Administrative/compliance/checkbox work
- Low visibility, low impact
- Could be automated or delegated and forgotten
- Consumes time without proportional value
- Tasks that are necessary evils, not value creators

**Effort Investment**: Just get it done. Actively try to do a bad job (meaning: don't polish, don't perfect, just complete it).

**Examples**:
- Filling out compliance forms
- Submitting administrative requests
- Logging time or status updates
- Scheduling routine meetings
- Acknowledging routine communications

## Key Principles

### 1. Leverage Over Effort

Senior PM effectiveness is about leverage, not effort. Working harder doesn't scale—working smarter does. Focus effort where it creates disproportionate impact.

### 2. Accept Constraints

Time scarcity is structural for product leaders, not a personal failure. Accept that you can't do everything perfectly. Design your approach around constraints.

### 3. Protect Thinking Time

L tasks require deep focus and thinking time. Protect this time as a first-class responsibility. Don't let O tasks consume time meant for L work.

### 4. Quality is Contextual

The same task might be L, N, or O depending on context:
- Strategic presentation to executives → L
- Routine team update → N
- Administrative form submission → O

### 5. Scope Changes the Job

As scope grows, the nature of impact changes. What was once L work might become N work as you delegate and enable others.

## Classification Criteria

When classifying a task, consider:

1. **Task Content**: Keywords, task type, description
   - Strategic/decision keywords → More likely L
   - Administrative keywords → More likely O
   - Routine execution → More likely N

2. **Strategic Alignment**: Does this relate to strategic priorities?
   - Strategic priorities with decision/planning work → More likely L
   - But don't auto-map P1 projects → L (project priority ≠ task leverage)

3. **Uniqueness**: Can only you do this?
   - Unique expertise required → More likely L
   - Others could do similar quality → More likely N or O

4. **Impact Multiplier**: Does this unlock other work?
   - Unlocks high-value initiatives → More likely L
   - Standalone execution → More likely N

5. **Visibility/Stakes**: How visible is the outcome?
   - High visibility, high stakes → More likely L
   - Low visibility, routine → More likely N or O

## Common Pitfalls

### Treating All Tasks Equally

**Problem**: Applying the same effort standard to all tasks.

**Solution**: Use LNO to calibrate effort investment. L tasks get deep focus, N tasks get good enough, O tasks get minimal time.

### Over-Investing in N/O Tasks

**Problem**: Spending too much time perfecting routine or administrative work.

**Solution**: Recognize when "good enough" is sufficient. Save perfectionism for L tasks.

### Under-Investing in L Tasks

**Problem**: Not protecting time for high-leverage work.

**Solution**: Block calendar time for L tasks. Treat them as first-class priorities.

### Auto-Mapping Project Priority to LNO

**Problem**: Assuming P1 projects = L tasks.

**Solution**: Project priority and task leverage are independent. A P1 project can have L, N, and O tasks.

### Ignoring O Tasks

**Problem**: Letting overhead tasks consume disproportionate time.

**Solution**: Batch O tasks, delegate when possible, or minimize time investment.

## Related Frameworks

### Radical Delegation Framework

LNO helps determine effort investment. Radical Delegation helps determine who should do the work. Together, they help product leaders optimize their time and impact.

- **L + Only You**: Focus deeply yourself
- **L + Various Folks**: Delegate to most suitable person (monitor closely)
- **N + Various Folks**: Delegate and forget
- **O + Only You**: Set up foundation, then coach someone else

### Scope & Impact Matrix

The PM Scope & Impact Matrix shows how impact changes as scope grows. LNO helps apply this at the task level—as your scope increases, more tasks become N or O, and fewer remain L.

### Eisenhower Matrix

Eisenhower Matrix categorizes by urgency and importance. LNO categorizes by leverage/effort investment. They complement each other:
- Important + Urgent + L → Deep focus, high priority
- Important + Not Urgent + L → Protect time, schedule deeply
- Important + Urgent + O → Minimize time, just complete

## Example Use Cases

### Daily Review with LNO

```
**Top Priority**
- [L] Create Q4 strategy framework - Strategic decision that shapes direction
- [N] Review team status updates - Routine execution, good enough quality
- [O] Submit compliance form - Administrative checkbox work

**LNO Summary**: L: 1 (focus deeply), N: 1 (good enough), O: 1 (minimize time)
```

### Weekly Planning with LNO

When planning your week, consider LNO distribution:
- Too many L tasks → May indicate over-investment, consider delegation
- Too many O tasks → Consider delegating, automating, or eliminating
- Balanced mix → Healthy distribution of effort investment

### Task Triage with LNO

When processing new tasks, LNO helps determine:
- Where to place in priority (L tasks often warrant higher status)
- How much time to allocate
- Whether to delegate or do personally

## Integration with Task Management

The LNO Framework integrates into task management systems by:

1. **Classification**: Analyzing tasks and suggesting L/N/O classifications
2. **Presentation**: Showing LNO classifications in daily/weekly reviews
3. **Recommendations**: Suggesting effort investment levels
4. **Distribution Analysis**: Tracking LNO distribution across workload

## Key Takeaways

- **L tasks** (~10X leverage): Focus deeply, let perfectionist shine
- **N tasks** (~1X leverage): Good enough quality, no better
- **O tasks** (<1X leverage): Just get it done, minimize time
- **Context matters**: Same task type can be L, N, or O depending on context
- **Don't auto-map**: Project priority ≠ task leverage
- **Protect L time**: Block calendar time for high-leverage work
- **Accept constraints**: Time scarcity is structural, design around it
