# Project vs Outcome Roadmap

## Purpose

Project vs Outcome Roadmaps help you choose between two roadmap formats based on your needs. Project-based roadmaps show specific features/projects, while outcome-based roadmaps focus on problems to solve and metrics to move, avoiding timeline commitments.

## When to Use

- When deciding how to structure your roadmap
- To communicate strategy without timeline commitments
- When you want to focus on problems, not solutions
- To avoid implied commitments to specific features
- When you need flexibility in how you achieve outcomes

## Key Components/Steps

### Project-Based Roadmap

**Structure**: Shows specific projects/features organized by quarter/timeframe

**Characteristics**:
- Presents product strategies (hypotheses)
- Shows specific projects/features
- Organized by quarters or timeframes
- Requires "No Commitment" speech to manage expectations

**Challenges**:
- Creates expectation of delivery on schedule
- Stakeholders often forget "No Commitment" caveat
- Implies commitment to specific projects

### Outcome-Based Roadmap

**Structure**: Shows problems to solve and metrics to move, organized by "Now, Next, & Consider"

**Characteristics**:
- Expresses "problem to be solved" in customer language
- Shows leading indicator metrics
- Uses "Now, Next, & Consider" instead of quarters
- Avoids implied timeline commitments

**Benefits**:
- Reinforces importance of moving metrics
- No implied commitment to timeline
- Focuses on problems, not solutions
- Brings customer voice into building

## Key Principles

- **Roadmaps express strategy**: Whether project or outcome-based, need strategy first
- **Roadmaps are storytelling tools**: Help company understand how work fits together
- **Style preference**: Both can work, choose what works for your context
- **Do hard work upfront**: Define strategies, metrics, then fill in roadmap
- **Outcome focus**: Emphasize problems and metrics over specific features

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating roadmap before defining strategy
- Not managing expectations with project-based roadmaps
- Making outcome roadmap too vague (still need some specificity)
- Not updating roadmap as you learn
- Focusing on features instead of problems/outcomes

## Related Frameworks

- **Strategy Creation**: Roadmaps express strategy, don't replace it
- **Now-Next-Later**: Outcome roadmaps use similar time horizons
- **GIST Framework**: Fits into outcome-based roadmap structure
- **Why Timeline Roadmaps Fail**: Outcome roadmaps avoid timeline pitfalls

## Example Use Cases

- **Project Roadmap**: Q1 = "Build checkout feature", Q2 = "Add payment options", Q3 = "Launch mobile app" (with "No Commitment" speech)
- **Outcome Roadmap**: Now = "Reduce checkout friction" (metric: conversion rate), Next = "Improve payment experience" (metric: payment success rate), Consider = "Expand payment methods" (metric: user satisfaction)
