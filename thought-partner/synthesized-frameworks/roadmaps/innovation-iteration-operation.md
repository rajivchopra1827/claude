# Innovation / Iteration / Operation

## Purpose

The Innovation/Iteration/Operation framework categorizes roadmap work into three types: Innovation (new capabilities), Iteration (improving existing), and Operation (maintaining/keeping lights on). This helps balance different types of work and ensure innovation doesn't get ignored.

## When to Use

- To categorize and balance different types of work
- When planning roadmap allocation
- To ensure innovation work doesn't get deprioritized
- When communicating roadmap to stakeholders
- To evaluate if you're spending too much time on operations

## Key Components/Steps

### Three Categories

**Innovation**:
- New capabilities or features
- Exploring new opportunities
- Building something that doesn't exist yet
- Higher risk, higher potential reward

**Iteration**:
- Improving existing features/products
- Optimizing current capabilities
- Incremental improvements
- Lower risk, steady improvement

**Operation**:
- Maintaining existing systems
- Keeping lights on
- Bug fixes, technical debt
- Necessary but not growth-oriented

### Allocation

Teams typically need to balance all three:
- **Too much Operation**: No innovation, product stagnates
- **Too much Innovation**: Existing product suffers, technical debt grows
- **Too much Iteration**: Incremental improvements but no breakthroughs

## Key Principles

- **Balance is key**: Need all three types of work
- **Innovation requires time**: Can't innovate if 100% on operations
- **Operation is necessary**: Can't ignore maintenance
- **Iteration drives improvement**: Steady improvements compound
- **Context matters**: Allocation depends on product stage, team size, market

## Common Pitfalls

- Spending too much time on operations (no innovation)
- Ignoring operations (technical debt, bugs accumulate)
- Only iterating (no breakthroughs)
- Not balancing the three types
- Not recognizing what category work falls into

## Related Frameworks

- **Three Horizons**: Innovation/Iteration/Operation relates to Horizon 1/2/3
- **3x Framework**: Innovation = Explore, Iteration = Expand, Operation = Extract
- **Roadmaps**: Use to categorize roadmap items
- **Strategy**: Different strategies require different allocations

## Example Use Cases

- **Roadmap Planning**: Allocate 60% Iteration, 30% Innovation, 10% Operation
- **Work Categorization**: Classify roadmap items into I/I/O buckets
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Explain why you're spending time on innovation vs operations
