# Why Timeline Roadmaps Fail

## Purpose

This framework explains why traditional timeline roadmaps (Gantt chart-style with dates) cause problems and fail. Understanding these failures helps you avoid them and choose better roadmap formats.

## When to Use

- When evaluating roadmap formats
- To understand why timeline roadmaps don't work
- When convincing stakeholders to move away from timelines
- To identify problems with current roadmap approach
- When planning to transition to outcome-based roadmaps

## Key Problems

### 1. Too Many Assumptions

**Problems**:
- Assumes you know what needs to be built months in advance
- Assumes you know how long each project will take
- Assumes features will work as expected when launched
- Assumes each feature should definitely exist
- **Biggest assumption**: Nothing will change

**Impact**: Building wrong things, missing opportunities, working toward outdated plans

### 2. Slows Down Your Team

**How it works**:
- Engineers give estimates (e.g., 1 week)
- PM adds buffer (1.5 weeks)
- For exec roadmap, shows 2 weeks
- **Parkinson's Law**: Work expands to fill time given
- Scope creeps, procrastination happens
- Team achieves less because everything takes SO MUCH time

**Impact**: Large, well-resourced teams deliver slower than small startup teams

### 3. Creates Technical Debt

**Why**:
- Developers always in deadline crunch
- Forced to make trade-offs (scope vs time)
- Skip quality, elegance, documentation to hit deadlines
- Never time for rework (already on next project)
- Stressful work environment → engineers leave
- Codebase becomes junk over time

**Impact**: Expensive refactoring needed, original developers gone

### 4. Vicious Cycle

**The Cycle**:
1. Timeline roadmap → deadline-driven work
2. Deadline crunches → bigger buffers
3. Longer estimations → riskier timelines
4. Execs want more control → tighter deadlines
5. No room for discovery/quality → wrong things built
6. Blame culture → even bigger buffers
7. Repeat

**Impact**: Hard to break out of, creates blame culture, reduces innovation

## Key Principles

- **Product management ≠ project management**: Product is about selecting what to build, not optimizing known scope
- **Estimates are always wrong**: Short-term estimates are less wrong, long-term are made up
- **Timeline roadmaps are comfort blankets**: Make stakeholders feel secure but set teams up for failure
- **Discovery requires flexibility**: Can't discover and learn if locked into timeline commitments
- **Outcomes over outputs**: Focus on what you achieve, not what you deliver

## Common Pitfalls

- Using timeline roadmaps because stakeholders want them
- Adding more buffer instead of changing approach
- Not recognizing the vicious cycle you're in
- Confusing product management with project management
- Committing to features before validating they're needed

## Related Frameworks

- **Now-Next-Later**: Alternative that avoids timeline problems
- **Outcome Roadmaps**: Focus on problems/metrics, not features/dates
- **GIST Framework**: Evidence-guided approach avoids assumptions
- **Project vs Outcome Roadmap**: Outcome approach avoids timeline pitfalls

## Example Use Cases

- **Roadmap Transition**: Use this framework to explain why you're moving away from timeline roadmaps
- **Stakeholder Education**: Help execs/sales understand why timeline roadmaps don't work
- **Team Alignment**: Align team on why you're using outcome-based roadmaps instead
