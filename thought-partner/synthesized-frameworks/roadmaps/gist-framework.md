# GIST Framework (Evidence-Guided)

## Purpose

GIST (Goals, Ideas, Step-projects, Tasks) is an evidence-guided framework for roadmapping that focuses on outcomes rather than timelines. It helps teams plan work in a way that allows for learning and iteration, avoiding the pitfalls of deadline-driven roadmaps.

## When to Use

- When creating product roadmaps
- To plan work that allows for discovery and learning
- When you want to focus on outcomes, not outputs
- To avoid deadline-driven planning
- When you need flexibility to adapt as you learn

## Key Components/Steps

### GIST Structure

1. **Goals**: Measurable outcomes you want to achieve
2. **Ideas**: Potential solutions/approaches to achieve goals
3. **Step-projects**: Small projects to test ideas and gather evidence
4. **Tasks**: Specific work items within step-projects

### Key Principles

- **Evidence-guided**: Make decisions based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Outcome-focused**: Goals are outcomes, not features
- **Small steps**: Step-projects are small enough to learn quickly
- **Iterative**: Ideas evolve based on learnings from step-projects
- **Flexible**: Can adapt goals/ideas as you learn

## Key Principles

- **Goals over features**: Focus on what you want to achieve, not what to build
- **Ideas are hypotheses**: Ideas are testable, not commitments
- **Small step-projects**: Break work into small, learnable chunks
- **Evidence-based decisions**: Use learnings to decide next steps
- **Continuous planning**: Update goals/ideas regularly based on evidence

## Common Pitfalls

- Making goals too feature-specific
- Creating step-projects that are too large
- Not gathering evidence from step-projects
- Not updating goals/ideas based on learnings
- Treating ideas as commitments

## Related Frameworks

- **ICE Prioritization**: Use to prioritize ideas within GIST
- **Assumption Mapping**: Ideas contain assumptions to test
- **Now-Next-Later**: GIST fits into time-horizon roadmaps
- **Outcome Roadmaps**: GIST is outcome-focused

## Example Use Cases

- **Product Roadmap**: Goal = "Increase user activation". Ideas = "Simplify onboarding", "Add tutorials", "Improve first-run experience". Step-projects = "Test simplified onboarding flow with 100 users".
- **Feature Development**: Goal = "Reduce checkout abandonment". Ideas = "Guest checkout", "Saved payment methods", "Progress indicators". Step-projects = "A/B test guest checkout option".
