# Now-Next-Later Roadmap

## Purpose

Now-Next-Later roadmaps organize work into three time horizons (immediate, near-term, long-term) without committing to specific deadlines. This format provides flexibility for discovery and learning while still communicating direction and priorities.

## When to Use

- When you need to communicate roadmap without timeline commitments
- To organize work by time horizons rather than deadlines
- When you want flexibility to adapt as you learn
- To focus on discovery rather than delivery dates
- When stakeholders need visibility without false certainty

## Key Components/Steps

### Three Columns

**Now**: 
- Initiatives you're working on right now
- Clearly defined, detailed, fully spec'd
- Broken down into granular work
- High confidence and clarity

**Next**:
- What happens after Now column is complete
- Less detailed, fewer specifics
- May depend on success/failure of Now items
- Understood to be next, but not fully planned

**Later**:
- Everything else proposed for undefined future
- Hazy, big boulder blocks
- General problems, not specific solutions
- Keeps vision consistent without detailed planning

### How to Use

1. **Prioritize at problem level**: Prioritize problems, not ideas
2. **Define product initiatives**: Connect problems to potential solutions
3. **Tie to business objectives**: Ensure initiatives align with business goals

## Key Principles

- **Time horizons, not timelines**: Focus on sequence, not dates
- **Problem-first**: Prioritize problems before solutions
- **Varying certainty**: Now is definite, Later is possibilities
- **Flexible**: Can adapt as you learn
- **Tied to objectives**: Initiatives connect to business goals

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating columns as equal in size (they shouldn't be)
- Making Later column too detailed (defeats purpose)
- Not updating as you learn (should be living document)
- Not tying to business objectives
- Prioritizing features instead of problems

## Related Frameworks

- **GIST Framework**: Fits into Now-Next-Later structure
- **Outcome Roadmaps**: Now-Next-Later is outcome-focused
- **Why Timeline Roadmaps Fail**: Now-Next-Later avoids timeline pitfalls
- **Strategy**: Roadmap expresses strategy over time

## Example Use Cases

- **Product Roadmap**: Now = "Improve onboarding flow". Next = "Add advanced features". Later = "Explore new user segments".
- **Feature Planning**: Now = "Build core feature". Next = "Add integrations". Later = "Consider enterprise features".
